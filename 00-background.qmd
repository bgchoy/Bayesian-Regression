This part revisits basic concepts of Bayesian Data Analysis. 
It encourages to **think like a computational Bayesian**, which is to think in terms of data-generating models and sampling processes.

To get more familiar with the mode of being, there are examples using the probabilistic programming language [WebPPL](http://webppl.org/).

Here are the [slides on regression modeling](slides/01-intro-simpleRegress.pdf).

Follow up [slides on priors and predictives](slides/02-priors-predictives.pdf).
