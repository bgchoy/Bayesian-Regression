We have recall rates y for 100 subjects at six different time points t (in seconds) after after memorization:\n\n\nToggle code\ndata_forget &lt;- tibble(\n  y = c(.94, .77, .40, .26, .24, .16),\n  t = c(  1,   3,   6,   9,  12,  18),\n  N = 100,\n  k = y * N\n)\n\ndata_forget |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = t, y = y)) +\n  geom_line(color = project_colors[6]) +\n  geom_point(color = project_colors[2], size = 2.5) +\n  ylim(0,1) +\n  xlab(\"time after memorization\") +\n  ylab(\"recall rate\") \n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two competing models on the table. The exponential model assumes that recall rates are predicted by exponential decay:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nk & \\sim \\text{Binomial}( \\theta, 100) \\\\\n\\theta &= a \\exp (-bt) \\\\\na,b & \\sim \\text{log-Normal}(0, 0.5)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nIn contrast, the power model assumes that forgetting curves follow a power function:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nk & \\sim \\text{Binomial}( \\theta, 100) \\\\\n\\theta &= ct^{-d} \\\\\nc,d &\\sim \\text{log-Normal}(0, 0.5)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nWe can think of these models as composed of a regular likelihood function (Binomial) with a non-linear predictor function \\(F(x,y)\\) (exponential or power), instead of the usual logistic-transformed linear predictor we know from logistic regression.\nTo define these non-linear models in brms, we use special syntax in the brmsformula. For the exponential model, for example, we use:\n\n\nToggle code\nbrms::bf(k | trials(N) ~ a * exp(-b * t), \n         a + b ~ 1, \n         nl=TRUE),\n\n\nNoteworthy here is that we can define the regressor part as a Stan function, introducing hitherto unknown variables a and b, which we can then regress against liner predictor terms. Since in the currenct case, we only want to fit these two parameters, we write this like an intercept-only model. Importantly, we must declare the model explicitly as a non-linear model using the parameter nl=TRUE.\nThe full function call also specifies priors for the parameters a and b (notice the explicit setting of a lower bound at zero). We also must declare the likelihood function (Binomial) and the link function (here: identity, because the non-linear predictor is the expected value already; not need to transform it with another link function).\n\n\nToggle code\nfit_exponential &lt;- brms::brm(\n    formula = brms::bf(k | trials(N) ~ a * exp(-b * t), \n                       a + b ~ 1, \n                       nl=TRUE),\n    data    = data_forget,\n    prior   = prior(lognormal(0,0.5), nlpar = \"a\", lb = 0) + \n              prior(lognormal(0,0.5), nlpar = \"b\", lb = 0),\n    family  = binomial(link = \"identity\"),\n    control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99)\n  )\n\n\nThe power model is set-up in parallel.\n\n\nToggle code\nfit_power &lt;- brms::brm(\n    formula = brms::bf(k | trials(N) ~ c * t^(-d), \n                       c + d ~ 1, \n                       nl=TRUE),\n    data    = data_forget,\n    prior   = prior(lognormal(0,0.5), nlpar = \"c\", lb = 0) + \n              prior(lognormal(0,0.5), nlpar = \"d\", lb = 0),\n    family  = binomial(link = \"identity\"),\n    control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99)\n  )\n\n\nLet’s try using leave-one-out cross-validation to address the question which model provides a fit to this data set.\n\n\nToggle code\nloo_compare &lt;- \n  loo_compare(\n    loo(fit_exponential), \n    loo(fit_power))\n\n\nThere is a problem. The loo function throws a warning that at least one observation is problematic under the Pareto-k diagnostic. We see that this is the first one:\n\n\nToggle code\nplot(loo(fit_power))\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that plot also shows that we may have done something weird! We have treated as a single data point all 100 observations for each time step. No wonder that some of these observations heavily influence to total likelihood. These observations are huge chunks of atomic observations.\nLet’s run these models again, but not as a Binomial model, but with a Bernoulli likelihood function, so that in LOO-based model comparison single observations are individual trials, not all trials from a given time point.

    "section": "",
    "text": "This tutorial provides both a conceptual and a practical introduction to fitting generalized additive models (GAMs) in brms. GAMs approximate wiggly curves by “smoothed splines”. The central idea to internalize here is that we can think of smoothed splines as a random effect. This is, indeed, how brms deals with GAMs.\nThe material here leans heavily on T.J. Mahr’s excellent tutorial.\n\nPreamble\nHere is code to load (and if necessary, install) required packages, and to set some global options (for plotting and efficient fitting of Bayesian models).\n\n\nToggle code\n# install packages from CRAN (unless installed)\npckgs_needed &lt;- c(\n  \"tidyverse\",\n  \"brms\",\n  \"rstan\",\n  \"rstanarm\",\n  \"remotes\",\n  \"tidybayes\",\n  \"bridgesampling\",\n  \"shinystan\",\n  \"mgcv\"\n)\npckgs_installed &lt;- installed.packages()[,\"Package\"]\npckgs_2_install &lt;- pckgs_needed[!(pckgs_needed %in% pckgs_installed)]\nif(length(pckgs_2_install)) {\n  install.packages(pckgs_2_install)\n} \n\n# install additional packages from GitHub (unless installed)\nif (! \"aida\" %in% pckgs_installed) {\n  remotes::install_github(\"michael-franke/aida-package\")\n}\nif (! \"faintr\" %in% pckgs_installed) {\n  remotes::install_github(\"michael-franke/faintr\")\n}\nif (! \"cspplot\" %in% pckgs_installed) {\n  remotes::install_github(\"CogSciPrag/cspplot\")\n}\n\n# load the required packages\nx &lt;- lapply(pckgs_needed, library, character.only = TRUE)\nlibrary(aida)\nlibrary(faintr)\nlibrary(cspplot)\n\n# these options help Stan run faster\noptions(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())\n\n# use the CSP-theme for plotting\ntheme_set(theme_csp())\n\n# global color scheme from CSP\nproject_colors = cspplot::list_colors() |&gt; pull(hex)\n# names(project_colors) &lt;- cspplot::list_colors() |&gt; pull(name)\n\n# setting theme colors globally\nscale_colour_discrete &lt;- function(...) {\n  scale_colour_manual(..., values = project_colors)\n}\nscale_fill_discrete &lt;- function(...) {\n   scale_fill_manual(..., values = project_colors)\n}\n\n\n\n\nData set and mission statement\nLet’s start with a common example for introductions to GAMs, the non-linear relationship between time (after impact) and acceleration (of the head of a motorcycle driver). The data is from the MASS package and it looks like this:\n\n\nToggle code\n# motorcycle data\ndata_motor &lt;- MASS::mcycle |&gt; \n  tibble() |&gt; \n  unique()\n\n# plot the data\ndata_motor |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = times, y = accel)) +\n  geom_smooth(color = project_colors[1]) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the plotting function geom_smooth already provides us with a smoothing line to fit the central tendency of this this “wiggly data”. But this one is not very good. We can probably do better.\nThe goals for the remainder of this tutorial are:\n\nTo understand how a wiggly curve can be constructed from a set of “atomic wiggles”.\nTo see the parallel between (i) fitting weights over “atomic wiggles”, with a penalty against excessive wiggliness, and fitting (ii) group-level effects.\nTo be able to run a Bayesian regression model with penalized smoothing splines using brms.\n\n\n\nWiggly curves as mixtures over “atomic wiggles”\nLet’s play a game! It’s called “make a wiggle”. Here’s how it’s played: I give you a bunch of “atomic wiggles”, you adjust some weights, and out pops … TADA! … a smoothing spline.\nOr, for those dull at heart, in technical terms, I give you a set of basis functions. This set is also called basis. Then you build intuitions about how, by adjusting numerical weights for the basis functions, we can flexibly approximate non-linear data.\nThe following code gives you a function get_basis() which takes as input a sequence of observations \\(x\\) for which we would like to construct a non-linear line. The output is a set of “atomic wiggles” (see plot below). The function also takes an integer value k as input, which is the number of “atomic wiggles” that you get.\nDo not worry about the details of this function, better to directly look at its output. But if you must know: this function uses the gam function from the mgcv package to construct (indirectly, through the model matrix internally built up by mgcv::gam) k cubic regression splines. The brms package uses the function mgcv:s which is called here in the model formula as well (more on this below).\n\n\nToggle code\n# create a set of /k/ splines for vector /x/\nget_basis &lt;- function(x, k = 20){\n  # fit a dummy GAM\n  fit_gam &lt;- mgcv::gam(\n    formula = y ~ s(times, bs = \"cr\", k = 20),\n    data    = tibble(y = 1, times = x))\n  # extract model matrix\n  model_matrix &lt;- model.matrix(fit_gam)\n  # wrangle to long tibble\n  some_curves &lt;- model_matrix |&gt; \n    as_tibble() |&gt; \n    mutate(x = x) |&gt; \n    pivot_longer(cols = -x) |&gt; \n    mutate(\n      name = str_replace(name, \"s\\\\(times\\\\).\", \"curve_\"))\n  return(some_curves)\n}\n\n\nLet’s construct a basis then and plot it:\n\n\nToggle code\nn_x = 1000\nx = seq(0,60, length.out = n_x)\n\nsome_curves &lt;- get_basis(x)\n\n# plot the basis\nsome_curves |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = value, color = name, group = name)) +\n  geom_line(size=1.5) + \n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(project_colors, project_colors)) +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\") +\n  ylab(\"\") + ggtitle(\"your basis\") +\n  xlab(\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\nTo play “make a wiggle” you also need a vector of weights, one for each basis function. Here is a function which, given a weight vector, computes the weighted average over all basis functions for a smooth prediction.\n\n\nToggle code\nmake_a_wiggle &lt;- function(some_curves, weights, data = NULL) {\n  \n  your_wiggly_line &lt;- some_curves |&gt; \n    mutate(\n      weight = rep(weights, n_x),\n      weighted_value = value * weight\n      ) |&gt; \n    group_by(x) |&gt; \n    summarize(wiggly_line = sum(weighted_value)) |&gt; \n    ungroup()\n  \n  your_wiggle_plot &lt;- your_wiggly_line |&gt; \n    ggplot(aes(x = x, y = wiggly_line)) + \n    geom_line(color = project_colors[1], size=1.5) + \n    ggtitle(\"your wiggly line\") +\n    xlab(\"x\") + ylab(\"\")\n    \n  your_wiggle_plot\n}\n\n\nAnd here are some examples:\n\n\nToggle code\nweights &lt;- c(0,2,-1,1,1,2,1,5,5,-7,1,1,1,10,1,1,1,1,1,1)\nmake_a_wiggle(some_curves, weights)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle code\nweights &lt;- c(-1,0.5,-2,-1,0,3,4,3,2,-1,-5,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2)\nmake_a_wiggle(some_curves, weights)\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd a not so wiggly wiggle:\n\n\nToggle code\nweights &lt;- c(0,1,10,rep(0, times = 17))\nmake_a_wiggle(some_curves, weights)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1: Try a manual fit\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay around with weights and try to find a constellation that approximates the shape of the motorcycle data in data_motor that we plotted above.\n\n\n\n\n\nPenalizing wiggliness and group-level effects\nWe saw how a vector of weights allows us to approximate non-linear relationship, once we have a set of elementary basis functions. To fit a non-linear regression model, the data should inform us about which vector of weights to use. So, essentially, we can just use the basis functions as linear predictors. There’s a lot of them, so that’s going to be ugly, but let’s do it:\n\n\nToggle code\nmotor_basis &lt;- get_basis(data_motor$times, nrow(data_motor)) |&gt; \n  mutate (accel = rep(data_motor$accel, each = 20)) |&gt; \n  rename(times = x) |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(name != \"(Intercept)\") |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(\"times\", \"accel\"), names_from = name, values_from = value, values_fn = mean)\n\nfit_motor_FE &lt;- brms::brm(\n  formula = accel ~ times + curve_1 + curve_2 + curve_3 + curve_4 + curve_5 + curve_6 + curve_7 + curve_8 + curve_9 + curve_10 +\n    curve_11 + curve_12 + curve_13 + curve_14 + curve_15 + curve_16 + curve_17 + curve_18 + curve_19,\n  data    = motor_basis,\n  prior   = prior(normal(0,50))\n)\n\n\nThis really only works if we specify some constraints via the priors for the coefficients! (Try a fit with improper priors!)\nHere is a plot of the posterior linear predictor:\n\n\nToggle code\nplot_post_linPred &lt;- function(fit, data) {\n  postPred &lt;- data |&gt; \n    tidybayes::add_epred_draws(fit) |&gt; \n    group_by(times,accel) |&gt; \n    summarize(\n      lower  = tidybayes::hdi(.epred)[1],\n      mean   = mean(.epred),\n      higher = tidybayes::hdi(.epred)[2]\n    )\n  \n  postPred |&gt; \n    ggplot(aes(x = times,  y = accel)) +\n    geom_line(aes(y = mean), color = project_colors[1], size = 2) +\n    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = higher), \n                fill = project_colors[6], alpha = 0.5) +\n    geom_point(size = 2)\n}\n\nplot_post_linPred(fit_motor_FE, motor_basis)\n\n\n\n\n\nThat looks like it’s on the right track, but it’s not wiggly enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Increasing smoothness of the predictor\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat could we do to make the linear predictor more curvy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bigger the fixed effect coefficients, the more the basis functions can affect the linear predictor. Currently, there are rather strong priors on the coefficients (A Gaussian with standard deviation 10). If we make these priors wider, we should see a much more curvy fit.\n\n\nToggle code\nfit_motor_FE_wider &lt;- brms::brm(\n  formula = accel ~ times + curve_1 + curve_2 + curve_3 + curve_4 + curve_5 + curve_6 + curve_7 + curve_8 + curve_9 + curve_10 +\n    curve_11 + curve_12 + curve_13 + curve_14 + curve_15 + curve_16 + curve_17 + curve_18 + curve_19,\n  data    = motor_basis,\n  prior   = prior(normal(0,500))\n)\n\nplot_post_linPred(fit_motor_FE_wider, motor_basis)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking stock so far, all of this shows that:\n\nBy adjusting weights of basis functions, we can get smoothed curves.\nThese weights can be learned from the data (visual results look good).\nBUT: the degree of smoothness is determined by the prior on coefficients.\n\nThe latter problem is worrisome because we do not want to manually adjust an important parameter like that. Ideally, the smoothness of the curve should be dictated by the data itself. Otherwise, we might overfit or remain too linear, so to speak.\nNotice that the parameter to tweak is the standard deviation of the normal distribution of the prior over coefficients. The smaller this is, the more linear a curve we predict. The bigger the more smoothed the fit. So, we want a model that let’s the data decide what the standard deviation is supposed to be for additive offsets to what is otherwise a vanilla regression model. But, hey, that’s exactly what group-level effects do, too!\nConcretely, we want a predictor \\(\\eta\\) which consists of the usual linear regression part \\(X \\beta\\) with an additional part \\(Z b\\), which specifies how much to deviate from the vanilla linear prediction. In the case at hand, the matrix \\(Z\\) is, essentially, the basis (rows are for each observation of times, columns correspond to the basis functions). We also want the coefficient’s \\(b\\) to be close to zero but with unknown variance, which is to be inferred from the data. The overal structure of this model is therefore:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\eta &= X \\beta + Z b \\\\\nb & \\sim \\mathcal{N}(o, \\sigma_b) \\\\\n\\sigma_b & \\sim \\dots \\text{some prior} \\dots\n\\end{align*}\n\\] And that is exactly the structure of a group-level / random-effects model. Random effects are supposed to be small, where what counts as small enough is to be determined by the data. Likewise, weights of basis functions are suppose to be small and, likewise, what counts as small is not to be fixed by hand but governed by the needs of the data. (Here we are again: we should think of group-level effects as putting up an (elastic) fence and letting the sheep graze where they want; a gentle anything-goes within a flexible margin.)\nIndeed, brms implements GAMs as, essentially, multi-level models, even though the touch-and-feel maybe different.\n\n\nImplementing GAMs in brms\nTo run a basic GAM in brms, just wrap the predictor to be smoothed in s(), which is brms-wrapper around the mgcv function of the same name.\n\n\nToggle code\nfit_motor &lt;- \n  brms::brm(\n    formula = accel ~ s(times, bs = \"cr\", k = 20),\n    data    = data_motor\n  )\n\n\nHere is the posterior linear predictor for this model, which looks fine:\n\n\nToggle code\nplot_post_linPred(fit_motor, data_motor)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is interesting to interpret the summary:\n\n\nToggle code\n# interpret this\nsummary(fit_motor)\n\n\n Family: gaussian \n  Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity \nFormula: accel ~ s(times, bs = \"cr\", k = 20) \n   Data: data_motor (Number of observations: 132) \n  Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\n         total post-warmup draws = 4000\n\nSmooth Terms: \n              Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsds(stimes_1)     4.89      1.18     3.09     7.67 1.00      927     1389\n\nPopulation-Level Effects: \n          Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nIntercept   -25.64      2.01   -29.56   -21.66 1.00     3953     2779\nstimes_1      1.65      0.33     0.98     2.30 1.00     3619     3194\n\nFamily Specific Parameters: \n      Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsigma    22.86      1.49    20.12    25.96 1.00     3121     2722\n\nDraws were sampled using sampling(NUTS). For each parameter, Bulk_ESS\nand Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential\nscale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).\n\n\nThe “Smooth Term” sds(stimes_1) is essentially the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) in the equations above. (The “sigma” is the usual standard deviation of the Gaussian likelihood function.) The intercept is the usual intercept, and the term “stimes_1” is the normal linear regressions slope. But these are so distorted by the penalized smooths in which they are wrapped that is is not prudent to draw strong conclusions from them (in my understanding; though I am not certain for it).\n\n\nExercises\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Posterior predictives\n\n\n\n\n\nThe previous plot showed ribbons for the 95% HDI for the linear predictor.

This could be due to the large uncertainty for early time points, which is not borne out by the data.

With every unit of log_RT_s these log odds become smaller by 0.23. The model predicts that the log odds for the mean log_RT_s in the touch group is 1.56 (0.86 + 0.70), i.e. much higher than in the click group. With every unit of log_RT_s these log odds become smaller by 0.22.\nThe baseline difference between click and touch group is compelling with more straight trajectories in the touch group. The effect of log_RT_s is also compelling with less straight trajectories for slower responses. This relationship is not compellingly modulated between the touch and the click group (virtually identical).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1d\n\n\n\n\n\nExtract the posteriors means and 95% CrIs for the relationships between straight, log_RT_s and group for representative range of log_RT_s values.

How do the model results differ and why could that be? (Feel free to explore the data to understand what is going on.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model in 1b suggested a negative coefficient of reaction time, i.e. slower responses lead to less straight trajectories. The model here suggests a positive coefficient for reaction time, i.e. slower responses lead to more straight trajectories. Given the data, the model, and the priors, this effect is compelling for at least the click group.\nA major difference in the two analyses is that the former analysis looked at all data and disregarded that responses came from clusters of sources. For example, responses that come from one and the same participant are dependent on each other because participants might differ in characteristics relevant to the task, like how fast they move and how many times they move to the target in a straight trajectory. The latter analysis aggregated participants behavior by looking at the proportion of straight trajectories within each subject, thus one data point corresponds to one participant, resulting in data points being independent (at least regarding the participant identity). If all participants showed a negative effect of reaction time on the likelihood of straight trajectories, but participants systematically differ in terms of their baseline correlation between reaction time and likelihood of producing straight trajectories in the opposite direction (positive relationship), we might get discrepancies between these different models. What we ultimately need is to take multiple levels of the data into account simultaneously, which is the topic of next week."

A good example of this latter effect arises when the number of observations in each group is not the same.

The mean-of-means, on the other hand, puts “counties first”, so to speak, and does not acknowledge that the number of observations each county contributed might be different. To understand how this can yield a difference, look at this picture:\n\n\nToggle code\ndata_radon |&gt; \n  group_by(county) |&gt; \n  summarize(mean_by_county = mean(log_radon),\n            n_obs_by_county = n()) |&gt;\n  mutate(county = fct_reorder(county, mean_by_county)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = mean_by_county, y = county)) +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\") +\n  xlab(\"mean log-radon\") + ylab(\"\") +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = empirical_mean), color = project_colors[2], size = 1.5) + \n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = emp_mean_of_means), color = project_colors[3], size = 1.5) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = n_obs_by_county), alpha = 0.7) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = empirical_mean - 0.4, y = 70, \n           label = \"sample mean\", color = project_colors[2], size = 7) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = emp_mean_of_means + 0.52, y = 20, \n           label = \"mean-of-means\", color = project_colors[3], size = 7) +\n  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \\(x\\)-position of the dots represents the mean for each county. The size of the dots represents the number of observations for each county. The sample mean (in red) is lower because some “heavier dots pull it to the left”. Reversely, the mean-of-means (in yellow) is “pulled more towards the right by the lighter dots” (since it doesn’t care about the size of the dots).\nWhich measure is correct? Neither! Or better: both! Or actually: it depends … on what we want. But actually: maybe we should let the data decide.\n\n\nGroup-level effects as smoothing terms\nSuppose we want a Bayesian measure (with quantified uncertainty) of the sample mean and the mean-of-means, how would we do it? (Maybe you want to think about this for a moment, before you uncover the solution below!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieve a Bayesian estimate of the sample mean and of the mean-of-means for the log-randon measure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sample mean is estimable with an intercept-only model.\n\n\nToggle code\nfit_InterOnly &lt;- brms::brm(\n  formula = log_radon ~ 1,\n  data    = data_radon\n)\n\n\nThe Bayesian estimate of the sample mean is given by the intercept term:\n\n\nToggle code\nsample_mean_estimate &lt;- \n  fit_InterOnly |&gt; tidybayes::tidy_draws() |&gt; \n  pull(b_Intercept) |&gt; \n  aida::summarize_sample_vector(name = \"sample mean\")\nsample_mean_estimate\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n  Parameter   `|95%`  mean `95%|`\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 sample mean   1.21  1.26   1.31\n\n\nThe mean-of-means can be estimated by running a regression model with county as population-level effect.\n\n\nToggle code\n# We need quite high iterations for this to fit properly \n# (likely to do the few observations in many of the groups).\nfit_FE &lt;- brms::brm(\n  formula = log_radon ~ county,\n  prior   = prior(student_t(1,0,10)),\n  iter    = 20000,\n  thin    = 5,\n  data    = data_radon\n)\n\n\nThis model yields estimates for the mean of each county. (There is some data wrangling to do to get at them, given the way categorical factors are treated internally, but that is a different matter). If we average the estimates properly (here using helper functions from the faintr package), we get an estimate of the mean-of-means:\n\n\nToggle code\n# estimated sample mean: 1.381\nmeanOmean_estimate &lt;- faintr::extract_cell_draws(fit_FE) |&gt; \n  pull(draws) |&gt; \n  aida::summarize_sample_vector(name = \"mean-of-means\")\nrbind(sample_mean_estimate, meanOmean_estimate)\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  Parameter     `|95%`  mean `95%|`\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 sample mean     1.21  1.26   1.31\n2 mean-of-means   1.30  1.38   1.46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn between these two options (no county variable vs. county as a population-level effect), there is a middle path: treating county as a group-level random intercept.\n\n\nToggle code\nfit_RE &lt;- brms::brm(\n  formula = log_radon ~ (1 | county),\n  data    = data_radon\n)\n\n\nIn this model, the intercept term is an estimate of the mean, but it is in between the estimated sample mean and the estimated mean-of-means:\n\n\nToggle code\npooled_mean &lt;- fit_RE |&gt; tidybayes::tidy_draws() |&gt; \n  pull(\"b_Intercept\") |&gt; \n  aida::summarize_sample_vector(name = \"pooled mean\")\nrbind(sample_mean_estimate, meanOmean_estimate, pooled_mean)\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  Parameter     `|95%`  mean `95%|`\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 sample mean     1.21  1.26   1.31\n2 mean-of-means   1.30  1.38   1.46\n3 pooled mean     1.26  1.35   1.44\n\n\nThis estimate is nuanced. It does take all data points into account (unlike the mean-of-mean). But (unlike the sample mean), it does weigh some data observations more heavily than others. In particular, counties with few but extreme observations receive, so to speak, less attention because “we explain away these observations as flukes for a given county”. In other words, we can think of group-level modeling also as a way of regularizing inference to differentially weigh observations, depending on which group they originated from.\nOkay, this may sound like a plausible rationalization of what one could do, but how do we know that the model actually behaves in this way? – By looking at what the model would predict for different counties. So, here is a plot of the a posteriori expected measurement for each county (ordered by size) together with the empirically observed mean-by-county:\n\n\nToggle code\nplotData_RE &lt;- data_radon |&gt; \n  group_by(county) |&gt; \n  summarize(mean_by_county = mean(log_radon),\n            n_observations = n()) |&gt; \n  tidybayes::add_epred_draws(\n    object = fit_RE\n  ) |&gt; \n  group_by(county, mean_by_county, n_observations) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    prediction_lower = tidybayes::hdi(.epred)[1],\n    prediction_mean = mean(.epred),\n    prediction_higher = tidybayes::hdi(.epred)[2]\n    ) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  mutate(county = fct_reorder(county, n_observations))\n\nplotData_RE |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = prediction_mean , y = county), size = 2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = mean_by_county), color = project_colors[2]) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = prediction_lower, xmax = prediction_higher), \n                color = \"gray\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  geom_segment(aes(y = county, yend=county, x = mean_by_county, xend=prediction_mean),\n              color = project_colors[2]) +\n  geom_point() +\n  ylab(\"\") +\n  xlab(\"mean log-radon\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows the counties on the \\(y\\)-axis, ordered number of observation from highest on the top to lowest on the bottom. The black dots are the means of the posterior predictive for each county (the gray error bars are 95% credible intervals for these estimates. The red dots are the empirically observed means for each county (the red lines indicating the differences between prediction and observation for each county).\nThis graph shows:\n\nThe higher the number of observations, the less uncertainty about the prediction.\nThe higher the number of observations, the less difference between prediction and observation.\n\nIt is the latter observation that lends credence to the interpretation above: the effect of random effects is differential weighing of observations in a data-driven manner; low certainty cases receive less weight, as they should."

The adapt_delta parameter is the minimum amount of accepted proposals (where to jump next) before “warm up” counts as done and successfull. So with a small problem like this, just making the adaptation more ambitious may have have solved the problem. It has also, however, made the sampling slower, less efficient.\nA powerful interactive tool for exploring a fitted model (diagnostics and more) is shinystan:\n\n\nToggle code\nshinystan::launch_shinystan(fit_good_adapt)\n\n\n\n\nA terrible model\nThe main (maybe only) reason for serious problems with the NUTS sampling is this: sampling issues arise for bad models. So, let’s come up with a really stupid model.\nHere’s a model that is like the previous but adds a second predictor., This second predictor is intended to be a normal (non-smoothed) regression coefficient that is almost identical to the original year information. You may already intuit that this cannot possibly be a good idea; the model is notionally deficient. So, we expect nightmares during sampling:\n\n\nToggle code\nfit_bad &lt;-\n  brms::brm(\n  formula = avg_temp ~ s(year) + year_perturbed, \n  data = aida::data_WorldTemp |&gt; mutate(year_perturbed = rnorm(1,year,0.001)),\n  seed = 1969\n) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\n\n\nThis model is deliberately set up to be stupid (and to mislead you).

Here, it does not matter whether the model was fitted to data or it is a “prior model”, so to speak, fit with the flag sample_prior = \"only\".\nHere is an example for a logistic regression model (where all the three measures clearly show their conceptual difference).\n\n\nToggle code\nfit_MT_logistic &lt;- \n  brms::brm(\n    formula = correct ~ group * condition,\n    data    = aida::data_MT,\n    family  = brms::bernoulli()\n  )\n\n\n\n\nToggle code\n# 2 samples from the predicted central tendency\naida::data_MT |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(group, condition) |&gt; \n  unique() |&gt; \n  tidybayes::add_epred_draws(\n    fit_MT_logistic,\n    ndraws = 2\n    )\n\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 7\n# Groups:   group, condition, .row [4]\n  group condition  .row .chain .iteration .draw .epred\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;      &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 touch Atypical      1     NA         NA     1  0.923\n2 touch Atypical      1     NA         NA     2  0.918\n3 touch Typical       2     NA         NA     1  0.950\n4 touch Typical       2     NA         NA     2  0.922\n5 click Atypical      3     NA         NA     1  0.883\n6 click Atypical      3     NA         NA     2  0.912\n7 click Typical       4     NA         NA     1  0.964\n8 click Typical       4     NA         NA     2  0.975\n\n\nToggle code\n# 2 samples from the predictive distribution (data samples)\naida::data_MT |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(group, condition) |&gt; \n  unique() |&gt; \n  tidybayes::add_predicted_draws(\n    fit_MT_logistic,\n    ndraws = 2\n    )\n\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 7\n# Groups:   group, condition, .row [4]\n  group condition  .row .chain .iteration .draw .prediction\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;      &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 touch Atypical      1     NA         NA     1           0\n2 touch Atypical      1     NA         NA     2           1\n3 touch Typical       2     NA         NA     1           1\n4 touch Typical       2     NA         NA     2           1\n5 click Atypical      3     NA         NA     1           0\n6 click Atypical      3     NA         NA     2           1\n7 click Typical       4     NA         NA     1           1\n8 click Typical       4     NA         NA     2           1\n\n\nToggle code\n# 2 samples for the linear predictor\naida::data_MT |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(group, condition) |&gt; \n  unique() |&gt; \n  tidybayes::add_linpred_draws(\n    fit_MT_logistic,\n    ndraws = 2\n    )\n\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 7\n# Groups:   group, condition, .row [4]\n  group condition  .row .chain .iteration .draw .linpred\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;      &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 touch Atypical      1     NA         NA     1     2.13\n2 touch Atypical      1     NA         NA     2     2.25\n3 touch Typical       2     NA         NA     1     2.77\n4 touch Typical       2     NA         NA     2     2.76\n5 click Atypical      3     NA         NA     1     1.89\n6 click Atypical      3     NA         NA     2     1.58\n7 click Typical       4     NA         NA     1     3.00\n8 click Typical       4     NA         NA     2     3.09"

    "text": "Bayesian linear regression with brms\nThe brms package allows us to run Bayesian regression models, both simple and rather complex. It uses a sampling method, so its output will be vectors of (correlated) samples from the posterior distribution of the model’s parameters.\nSo, to quantify evidence and uncertainty with posterior samples, let’s run a simple linear regression model using brms. We use the R’s standard notation at first (though brms extends this syntax substantially for more complex models) to specify a formula in which AUC is predicted by MAD.\nAUC ~ MAD\nWhen you run this code, the brms package generates Stan code and runs the Stan program in the background. Stan code is executed in C++, and the model will be ‘compiled’ (you get information about this in the console output). You we will want to learn later what this compilation does (spoiler: it computes gradients for all stochastic nodes in the model). The only thing that is relevant for you at the moment is this: This compilation can take quite a while (especially for complex models) before anything happens.\n\n\nToggle code\n# specify the model \nmodel1 = brm(\n  # model formula\n  AUC ~ MAD, \n  # data\n  data = dolphin_agg\n  )\n\n\n\n\nToggle code\nsummary(model1)\n\n\n Family: gaussian \n  Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity \nFormula: AUC ~ MAD \n   Data: dolphin_agg (Number of observations: 108) \n  Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\n         total post-warmup draws = 4000\n\nPopulation-Level Effects: \n          Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nIntercept   475.20   1817.35 -3071.30  4034.48 1.00     4365     2708\nMAD         454.90     15.78   423.89   485.88 1.00     4004     2821\n\nFamily Specific Parameters: \n      Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsigma 17170.94   1190.49 15013.49 19821.21 1.00     3910     2616\n\nDraws were sampled using sampling(NUTS). For each parameter, Bulk_ESS\nand Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential\nscale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).\n\n\nThe output of such a model looks very familiar if you have worked with lm() before. We want to look at what is here called “Population-Level Effects”, which is a small table in this case. The first column contains the names of our coefficients; the Estimate column gives us the posterior mean of these coefficients; the Est.Error give us the standard error; the l-95%and u-95% give us the lower and upper limit of the 95% Credible Interval (henceforth CrI). The column Rhat (R^) which is a diagnostic of chain convergence and should not diverge much from 1 (rule of thumb: should by &lt;1.1). Again, more about that later. The Bulk_ESS and Tail_ESS columns give us numbers of “useful” samples. This number should be sufficiently high. If its not, brms will give you a convenient warning (more about that later, so don’t worry for now). If that happens, you need to increase the chains and / or the number of iterations in order to increase the overall number of samples (again, don’t worry for now).\nIf we need the main summary output in a tidy tibble format, we can use this function from the tidybayes package:\n\n\nToggle code\ntidybayes::summarise_draws(model1)\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 10\n  variable       mean  median        sd       mad      q5     q95  rhat ess_bulk\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;num&gt;   &lt;num&gt;     &lt;num&gt;     &lt;num&gt;   &lt;num&gt;   &lt;num&gt; &lt;num&gt;    &lt;num&gt;\n1 b_Intercept   475.    508.  1817.     1784.     -2610.   3432.   1.00    4365.\n2 b_MAD         455.    455.    15.8      15.4      429.    481.   1.00    4004.\n3 sigma       17171.  17108.  1190.     1136.     15324.  19285.   1.00    3910.\n4 lprior        -22.3   -22.3    0.0288    0.0277   -22.4   -22.3  1.00    4153.\n5 lp__        -1218.  -1218.     1.22      0.988  -1221.  -1217.   1.00    1898.\n# ℹ 1 more variable: ess_tail &lt;num&gt;\n\n\nThe model output suggests that the posterior mean of the Intercept is around 500. The coefficient for MAD is estimated to be about 450.\nTo see how good a fit this is, we should manually draw this line into the graph from above.\n\n\nToggle code\n# extract model parameters:\nmodel_intercept &lt;- summary(model1)$fixed[1,1]\nmodel_slope &lt;- summary(model1)$fixed[2,1]\n\n# plot\nggplot(data = dolphin_agg, \n       aes(x = MAD, \n           y = AUC)) + \n  geom_abline(intercept = model_intercept, slope = model_slope, color = project_colors[2], size  = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.3, color = project_colors[1])\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the graph, it does make sense, right? The red line seems to capture the main trend pretty well.\nNow is there a relationship between AUC and MAD? What would it mean if there was no relationship between these two measures? Well no relationship would mean a slope of 0. How would that look like?\n\n\nToggle code\nggplot(data = dolphin_agg, \n       aes(x = MAD, \n           y = AUC)) + \n  geom_abline(intercept = model_intercept, slope = model_slope, color = project_colors[2], size = 1) +\n  geom_abline(intercept = model_intercept, slope = 0, color = project_colors[3], size = 1, lty = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.3, color = project_colors[1])\n\n\n\n\n\nThese lines look quite different indeed. But Bayesian data analysis does not give us only one single line. It gives us infinitely many lines, weighted by plausibility. Let’s explore this universe of weighted predictions."

We can create a data frame with all posterior samples for each parameter and plot those distributions for all coefficients.

Now let’s wrangle this data frame to get what we need. You don’t have to entirely understand the following code, but make sure you understand it well enough to recycle it later on.\n\n\nToggle code\n# wrangle data frame\nposteriors1 &lt;- model1 |&gt;\n  tidybayes::spread_draws(b_MAD, b_Intercept) |&gt;\n  select(b_MAD, b_Intercept)\n\nposteriors1\n\n\n# A tibble: 4,000 × 2\n   b_MAD b_Intercept\n   &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  460.      -169. \n 2  441.      1744. \n 3  469.      1947. \n 4  433.       -42.9\n 5  477.      1043. \n 6  489.      1838. \n 7  488.      -494. \n 8  452.      2947. \n 9  454.      2957. \n10  447.      1258. \n# ℹ 3,990 more rows\n\n\nNow that we know how to extract posterior samples, let’s actually take a bunch of these samples and plot them as lines into our scatter plot from above. In this code chunk we generate a subsample of 100 parameter pairs. (There are methods to directly sample from the posterior values of the linear predictor, which is what you want to use for complex models, but here we go full hands-on.)\n\n\nToggle code\n# wrangle data frame\nposteriors2 &lt;- model1 |&gt;\n  # parameter 'ndraws' requests 100 random subsamples\n  tidybayes::spread_draws(b_MAD, b_Intercept, ndraws = 100) |&gt;\n  select(b_MAD, b_Intercept)\n  \n# plot\nggplot(data = dolphin_agg, \n       aes(x = MAD, \n           y = AUC)) + \n  geom_abline(data = posteriors2,\n              aes(intercept = b_Intercept, slope = b_MAD), \n              color = project_colors[2], size  = 0.1, alpha = 0.4) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.3, color = project_colors[1]) +\n  theme_aida()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven our model, assumptions and data, these are 100 plausible regression lines. As you can see they are very similar.\nUsing this pipeline we can also calculate the mean of the posteriors and any kind of Credible Interval (CrI). We first extract the posterior and bring them into a tidy form. Let’s only look at the coefficient for MAD here.\n\n\nToggle code\nposteriors3 &lt;- model1 |&gt;\n   # use the gather_draws() function for \"long data\"\n   tidybayes::gather_draws(b_MAD) |&gt; \n   # change names of columns\n   rename(parameter = .variable,\n          posterior = .value) |&gt; \n   # select only those columns that are relevant\n   select(parameter, posterior)\n\nhead(posteriors3)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n# Groups:   parameter [1]\n  parameter posterior\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 b_MAD          460.\n2 b_MAD          441.\n3 b_MAD          469.\n4 b_MAD          433.\n5 b_MAD          477.\n6 b_MAD          489.\n\n\nAnd then calculate the mean, the lower and the upper bound of a 90% CrI, using the function tidybayes::hdi().\n\n\nToggle code\n# get posteriors for the relevant coefficients\nposteriors3_agg &lt;- posteriors3 |&gt; \n  group_by(parameter) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    `90lowerCrI`   = tidybayes::hdi(posterior, credMass = 0.90)[1],\n    mean_posterior = mean(posterior),\n    `90higherCrI`  = tidybayes::hdi(posterior, credMass = 0.90)[2])\n\nposteriors3_agg \n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n  parameter `90lowerCrI` mean_posterior `90higherCrI`\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 b_MAD             425.           455.          487.\n\n\nNow we use this newly created data frame to plot the posterior distributions of all population-level coefficients. Again, we use our new best friend, the tidybayes package which offers some sweet extensions to ggplot’s geom_ family of functions. We also add a reference point to compare the posteriors against. A common and reasonable reference point is 0. Remember a slope coefficient of zero would correspond to a flat regression line.\n\n\nToggle code\n# plot the regression coefficients\nposteriors1 |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = \"parameter\", values_to = \"posterior\") |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = posterior, y = parameter, fill = parameter)) + \n    # plot density w/ 90% credible interval\n    tidybayes::stat_halfeye(.width = 0.9) +\n    # add axes titles\n    xlab(\"\") +\n    ylab(\"\") +\n    # adjust the x-axis \n    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-100,600)) +\n    # add line for the value zero\n    geom_segment(x = 0, xend = 0, y = Inf, yend = -Inf,\n                 lty = \"dashed\") +\n    theme(legend.position=\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle code\nposteriors3_agg[1,2]\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `90lowerCrI`\n         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1         425.\n\n\nHere you see density plots for our critical coefficients of the model. We care mostly about the slope coefficient (b_MAD) (the posterior of which is shown in red). Values between about 425.1 and about 486.68 are plausible (at the 90% level) and they are indicated by the thick black line in the density plot for this coefficient. The mean of the distribution is indicated by the thick black dot.\nThat’s helpful because we can relate this distribution to relevant values, for example the value 0 (dashed line). If you look at the coefficient, you can see that the posterior distribution does not include the value zero or any small-ish “Region of Practical Equivalence” around it. In fact, the posterior is really far away from zero. Thus, if we believe in the data and the model, we can be very certain that this coefficient is not zero. In other words, we would be very certain that there is a positive relationship between AUC and MAD (and in turn that ‘no relationship’ is not a very plausible scenario).\nThe brms package allows us to quickly evaluate how many posterior samples fall into a certain value range. Just for fun, let’s calculate the amount of posterior samples that are larger than 450. The following code chunk does this for us:\n\n\nToggle code\nhypothesis(model1, 'MAD &gt; 450')\n\n\nHypothesis Tests for class b:\n       Hypothesis Estimate Est.Error CI.Lower CI.Upper Evid.Ratio Post.Prob\n1 (MAD)-(450) &gt; 0      4.9     15.78   -20.81    30.74       1.71      0.63\n  Star\n1     \n---\n'CI': 90%-CI for one-sided and 95%-CI for two-sided hypotheses.\n'*': For one-sided hypotheses, the posterior probability exceeds 95%;\nfor two-sided hypotheses, the value tested against lies outside the 95%-CI.\nPosterior probabilities of point hypotheses assume equal prior probabilities.\n\n\nThe results tell us that more than 60% of all posterior samples are larger than 450. It also tells us the evidence ratio (more on this later), which is the odds of the hypothesis in question (here ’MAD &gt; 450)."

    "text": "Explanation\nIn logistic regression, the response variable \\(y\\) is binary, i.e., we want to predict the probability \\(p\\) with which one of two possible outcomes (henceforth: the reference outcome) occurs. The likelihood function for this case is the Bernoulli distribution. This requires a link function \\(LF\\) that maps real-valued linear predictor values \\(\\eta\\) onto the unit interval. A common choice is the logistic function:\n\\[\n\\text{logistic}(\\eta) = \\frac{1}{1+ \\exp(-\\eta)} = \\xi\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe logistic regression model is then defined as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\eta_i  &= \\mathbf{x}_i \\cdot \\beta       && \\color{gray}{\\text{[linear predictor]}} \\\\\n\\xi_i &= \\text{logistic}(\\eta_i) && \\color{gray}{\\text{[predictor of central tendency]}} \\\\\ny_i & \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(\\xi_i) && \\color{gray}{\\text{[likelihood]}}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThe linear predictor values \\(\\eta\\) can be interpreted directly, as the log odds-ratio of the predicted probability \\(\\xi\\). This is because the inverse of the logistic function is the logit function, which has the following form:\n\\[\n\\text{logit}(\\xi) = \\log \\frac{\\xi}{1-\\xi} = \\eta\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means that differences between linear predictor parameters can be interpreted directly as something like the “evidence ratio” or “Bayes factor”. It is the log of the factor by which to transform log odds-ratios (e.g., changing beliefs from \\(\\xi_1\\) to \\(\\xi_2\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\eta_1 - \\eta_2 = \\log \\frac{\\xi_1}{1-\\xi_1} - \\log \\frac{\\xi_2}{1-\\xi_2} = \\log \\left ( \\frac{\\xi_1}{1-\\xi_1} \\frac{1-\\xi_2}{\\xi_2}\\right ) \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & \\frac{\\xi_1}{1-\\xi_1} = \\exp (\\eta_1 - \\eta_2) \\ \\frac{\\xi_2}{1-\\xi_2}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nFor the purposes of understanding which priors are weakly or strongly informative, a unit difference in the linear predictor can be interpreted as a log Bayes factor (changing prior odds to posterior odds). So a unit difference in the predictor value corresponds to a Bayes factor of around 2.72."

A common choice of link function for this case is the cumulative logit function which takes the linear predictor and a vector \\(\\delta\\) of \\(k-1\\) thresholds as arguments to return a probability vector, here denoted as \\(\\mathbf{p}\\), whose components are defined like so:\n\\[\np_j = \\text{cumulative-logit}(\\eta_1; \\delta) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\text{logistic}(\\delta_1 - \\eta_1) & \\text{if } j=1 \\\\\n\\text{logistic}(\\delta_{i} - \\eta_1) - p_{j-1} & \\text{if } j&gt;1 \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nTo see what is going on, consider the a case with three categories. Fix the two threshold \\(\\delta_1=-0.75\\) and \\(\\delta_2=1.6\\) just for illustration. Now assume that we have a case there the linear predictor value \\(p\\) is zero. The cumulative logit function above then entails the category probabilities as shown in this plot, as the length of the colored bar segments:\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the linear predictor \\(\\xi\\) is estimated to be bigger than zero, this intuitively means that we shift all of the threshold to the left (by the same amount). For example, the plot below shows the case of \\(\\xi=1\\) where the probability of the first category decreases while that of the third increases.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn sum, the cumulative-logit model for ordinal regression, is defined as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\eta_i  &= \\mathbf{x}_i \\cdot \\beta       && \\color{gray}{\\text{[linear predictor]}} \\\\\n\\xi_i &= \\text{cumulative-logit}(\\eta_i; \\delta) && \\color{gray}{\\text{[predictor of central tendency]}} \\\\\ny_i & \\sim \\text{Categorical}(\\xi_i) && \\color{gray}{\\text{[likelihood]}}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]"

(Notice that these are more informative than standard deviations in the sense that they give an upper and lower deviation, not just one number for both directions, which can be misleading when the data is skewed (like reaction times typically are)):\n\n\nToggle code\ndolphin_aggregate2 &lt;-\n  dolphin_filter3 |&gt;\n  group_by(group, condition) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    lower_CI = tidyboot::ci_lower(RT),\n    mean_RT  = mean(RT, na.rm = T),\n    upper_CI = tidyboot::ci_upper(RT)\n    )\n\n# show the aggregated df\ndolphin_aggregate2\n\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 5\n# Groups:   group [2]\n  group condition lower_CI mean_RT upper_CI\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 click Atypical     1030.   2417.    7311.\n2 click Typical       950    1847.    4698.\n3 touch Atypical      750    1900.    5368.\n4 touch Typical       686.   1486.    3955.\n\n\nWe can see here that the group that needed to click on a response are overall slower than touch responses, but also much more variable in their behavior."

Is 1 a large difference or a small difference? For example when we want to explore the impact of several predictors on the same measurement, we want to know the relative size of a number. To achieve this, we standardize measures by dividing their mean by their respective standard deviations. We will use the scale() function for this and create a new variable in our data frame via mutate().\n(Note that the scale() function creates an object that is of the matrix class. That is fine for the most part but might create issues later on. To avoid any issues, we wrap the scale() function in as.numeric() to store the results as a numeric vector.)\n\n\nToggle code\ndolphin_standardize &lt;-\n  dolphin_selected |&gt;\n  mutate(RT_scale = as.numeric(scale(RT)))\n  \nhead(dolphin_standardize)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n     RT group condition category_correct correct RT_scale\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1   950 touch Atypical  fish                   1   -0.552\n2  1251 touch Typical   reptile                1   -0.373\n3   930 touch Atypical  mammal                 0   -0.564\n4   690 touch Atypical  Insekt                 1   -0.706\n5   951 touch Typical   bird                   1   -0.551\n6  1079 touch Atypical  bird                   1   -0.475\n\n\nIf we now compare, say atypical and typical categories according to reaction times, we can use the standardized RT ratings.

Let’s also add a title to our plot.\n\n\nToggle code\nggplot(dolphin_agg, aes(x = condition, y = mean_RT)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  ggtitle(\"a bare bar plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle code\n  # stat = \"identity\" takes the number in the dataset as the bar height (as opposed to a 'count')\n\n\nUgh! What an ugly plot, right? But it’s already telling a story: Atypical categories are responded to slower than typical categories. Let’s add a measure of uncertainty, in our case the bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, as error bars to the plot:\n\n\nToggle code\nggplot(dolphin_agg, aes(x = condition, y = mean_RT)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") + \n  \n  # this is the added layer\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_CI, \n                    ymax = upper_CI), \n                colour = \"black\",\n                linewidth = 0.5) +\n  \n  ggtitle(\"a bare bar plot with error bars\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can observe a couple of things here. First, ggplot automatically adjust the axes based on the elements to be plotted unless we tell it not to. Second, the error bars are plotted in front of the bars, i.e. closer to the viewer. This visual ordering reflects the order of layers. We first plotted the bars and THEN the error bars.\nBeyond bar plots, we can create other useful plots types. For example a point plot. Instead of a bar, we plot the mean RT as points.\n\n\nToggle code\nggplot(dolphin_agg, aes(x = condition, y = mean_RT)) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_CI, \n                    ymax = upper_CI), \n                colour = \"black\") +  \n  # this is the new geom \n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"a point plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr a line plot that connects the means with a line. For the line plot to work, we need to indicate a group aesthetic, i.e. the group that we want to connect with a line. If you have for example several interacting categories, you need to indicate which groups are supposed to be connected with lines (see below). Because we have only one group here, condition, we set group to 1.\n\n\nToggle code\nggplot(dolphin_agg, aes(x = condition, y = mean_RT, group = 1)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  ggtitle(\"a line plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYay, we are on a roll. Let’s plot a box plot. Remember the box shows the median (middle vertical line) and the interquartile range (the middle 50% of the data within the box). Note that for the box plot, we do not plot aggregated values, so we need to refer to the entire data set. We also add the aesthetic fill here and set it to the variable condition to color code our boxes.\n\n\nToggle code\n# we changed the dataset referred to\nggplot(dolphin, aes(x = condition, y = RT, fill = condition)) +\n  # this is the new geom \n  geom_boxplot() +\n  ggtitle(\"a box plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the above plots illustrate one continuous variable (RT) plotted against a categorical variable (condition), we can also plot two continuous variables against each other. For example, we could plot RT against AUC in a scatter plot.\n\n\nToggle code\n# we changed the y aesthetic to `Hardness`\nggplot(dolphin_subset, aes(x = RT, y = AUC)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"a scatter plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, one central plot type for our class. The density plot. It plots on the x-axis a continous value and on the y-axis the “density”” of these values. So high values on the y-axis means a lot of data at the corresponding x-values. The density curve can be outlined with color and filled with fill. To keep the two categories visually distinct, we add an argument to the geom_density() function: alpha. Alpha controls the transparency of the color! We will see a lot of these density plots in our class.\n\n\nToggle code\nggplot(dolphin, aes(x = RT, color = condition, fill = condition)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  ggtitle(\"a density plot\")"

These plots are exceptionally ugly and of limited communicative value so far. Note that this is perfectly fine during an exploratory phase of data analysis. If we just eye-ball data and we have no trouble interpreting the plots, thats just fine. However, as soon as we want to communicate patterns to others with these graphs, we need to take a little bit more care of its communicative value. Let’s look at ways we can tailor our plots to the needs of an audience.\nLet’s go back to our bar plot and explore whether condition and group has an impact on RT?\n\n\nToggle code\n# First we aggregate RT for group and condition\ndolphin_agg2 &lt;- dolphin_subset |&gt;\n  group_by(group, condition) |&gt;\n  summarise(mean_RT = mean(RT),\n            sd_RT = sd(RT))\n\n# then we plot and color code for condition (note that, for bar plots, the aesthetic of `color` refers to the border of the bar, and `fill` refers to the actual colour of the bar)\n\nggplot(dolphin_agg2, aes(x = condition, y = mean_RT, fill = group)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHm… that doesn’t work out, the bars are on top of each other, we need to tell ggplot to position the bars next to each other instead. We do that with position_dogde(). Note that ggplot assigns a default color coding scheme to your plots if you don’t specify it by hand.\n\n\nToggle code\nggplot(dolphin_agg2, aes(x = condition, y = mean_RT, fill = group)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAwww much better! Alternatively, we can plot the two categories into separate panels. We achieve this by facetting using the facet_grid() function.\n\n\nToggle code\nggplot(dolphin_agg2, aes(x = group, y = mean_RT, fill = condition)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge()) +\n  # this is the facetting function\n  facet_grid(~ condition)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay. We are getting somewhere. We already learned something again. Apparently, the effect of typiciality on RT is pretty similar across tasks. It does not look like we have an interaction here (more on interactions later).\nNow let’s make these plots ready to communicate information. We add appropriate axes titles. Note that we are using a little hack here: The “” inserts an empty line, creating visual distance from axis title to axis, thus making it easier to read it. Our audience will thank us.\n\n\nToggle code\nggplot(dolphin_agg2, aes(x = group, y = mean_RT, fill = condition)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge()) +\n  facet_grid(~ condition) +\n  # add axis titles\n  xlab(\"\\n task\") +\n    ylab(\"mean response latency in ms\\n\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same graph as a point / line plot indicated to the audience whether there is an interaction pattern or not. Note that here we do not facet because we actually want the points to be plotted within the same horizontal space. We also have to specify the group aesthetic to tell ggplot which points to connect with lines.\n\n\nToggle code\nggplot(dolphin_agg2, aes(x = group, y = mean_RT, color = condition, group = condition)) +\n  # instead of geom_bar we use geom_point and geom_line\n  geom_point(size = 12) +\n  geom_line(size = 2) +\n  xlab(\"\\n task\") +\n  ylab(\"mean response latency in ms\\n\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle code\n  # # need to change to the color aesthetic instead of fill\n  # scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), breaks = (c(0, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000)), limits = c(0,3000))\n\n\nThese lines look pretty parallel and don’t indicate a strong interaction pattern. But how do different exemplars differ? Let’s aggregate for individual exemplars first and then create the same plot for the means of all exemplars.\n\n\nToggle code\ndolphin_agg3 &lt;- dolphin_subset |&gt; \n  group_by(exemplar, group, condition) |&gt; \n  summarise(mean_RT = mean(RT, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nggplot(dolphin_agg3, aes(x = group, y = mean_RT, color = condition, group = exemplar)) +\n  # instead of geom_bar we use geom_point and geom_line\n  geom_point(size = 6, alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_label(aes(label = exemplar)) +\n  xlab(\"\\n task\") +\n  ylab(\"mean response latency in ms\\n\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like “shark” and “rattlesnake” behave very different from their buddies in the typical condition.

A simple normal distribution provides a likelihood for a single response variable \\(y\\) based on a pair of single numbers for mean \\(x\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\):\n\\[\ny \\sim \\mathcal{N}(x, \\sigma)\n\\]\nA multivariate Gaussian extends this to provide a probability of a vector \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) of \\(k\\) finite numbers for a \\(k\\)-place vector of means \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and a \\(k \\times k\\) covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\):\n\\[\n\\mathbf{y} \\sim \\text{MV-Normal}(\\mathbf{x}, \\Sigma)\n\\]\nOne heuristic way of thinking of a Gaussian process is as a whole (infinite) set of systematically related multi-variate normal distributions. For each vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) of means, with arbitrary finite length \\(k\\), this set contains a multi-variate normal distribution for us. So, we are not stuck with one specific \\(k\\), but we have exactly one for each \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) no matter what \\(k\\), as long as it is finite.\nTo obtain such a set, we construct a function which, for a given \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), constructs a covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\) for us in a systematic way. This is done via a so-called kernel. The kernel is what gives us the “systematicity” in our set of multi-variate normal distributions. (It also regulates the overal shape of functions implied by the Gaussian process; more on this below.)\nThere are many different useful kernels, but the most salient one is perhaps the radial basis function kernel. It is defined as follows:\n\\[\nk(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}') = \\sigma_f^2 \\ \\exp \\left [ - \\frac{||\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}'||^2}{2 \\lambda}\\right]\n\\]\nHere \\(||\\cdot||\\) is the Euclidean norm, defined as \\(||\\mathbf{x}|| = \\sqrt{x_1^2 + \\dots + x_k^2}\\), an expression of the length of a vector. There are two parameters in the radial basis kernel:\n\n\\(\\sigma_f\\) is signal variance, and\n\\(\\lambda\\) is the *length scale.\n\nFor a given vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), we can use the kernel to construct finite multi-variate normal distribution associated with it like so:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{x} \\mapsto_{GP} \\text{MV-Norm}(m(\\mathbf{x}), k(\\mathbf{x},  \\mathbf{x}))\n\\]\nwhere \\(m\\) is a function that specifies the mean for the distribution associated with \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). This mapping is essentially the Gaussian process: a systematic association of vectors of arbitrary length with a suitable multi-variate normal distribution.\n\n\nA compact prior over functions\nCool, but why do we care? We care because a Gaussian process (GP) allows us to specify a vast amount of non-linear curves, so to speak. More concretely, a GP, defined by a kernel \\(k(\\cdot)\\), a mean function \\(m(\\cdot)\\), and the parameters \\(\\sigma_f\\) and \\(\\lambda\\), implies a prior of functions. This is very abstract and best explored through simulation.\nHere are two convenience functions. The first is called get_GP_simulation and it samples from a Gaussian process regression. It takes as input a vector x to generated predictions for, values for the kernel parameters sigma_f and lambda and also the usual simple linear regression parameters Intercept, slope and sigma. The second function is called plot_GP_simulation takes as input what the first function delivers and provides a plot.\nUsing these functions we can explore how we can “generate wiggly lines” for different input vectors x and parameter settings.\n\n\nToggle code\nget_GP_simulation &lt;- \n  function(x = seq(0,10, by = 0.1), \n           Intercept = 0, \n           slope = 1, \n           sigma = 1, \n           sigma_f=0.5, \n           lambda=100, \n           seed = NULL) {\n    \n    if (! is.null(seed)){\n      set.seed(seed)\n    }\n    \n    # number of points to generate prediction for\n    N &lt;- length(x)\n    \n    # linear predictor (vanilla LM)\n    eta = Intercept + slope * x\n    \n    # kernel function (here: radial basis function kernel)\n    get_covmatrix &lt;- function(x, sigma_f, lambda) {\n      K = matrix(0, nrow=N, ncol=N)\n      for (i in 1:N) {\n        for (j in 1:N) {\n          K[i,j] = sigma_f^2 * exp(sqrt((i-j)^2) / (-2 *lambda))\n        }\n      }\n      return(K)\n    }\n    \n    # covariance matrix\n    K &lt;- get_covmatrix(x, sigma_f, lambda)\n    \n    # Gaussian process wiggles\n    epsilon_gp &lt;- mvtnorm::rmvnorm(\n      n     = 1, \n      mean  = rep(0, N),\n      sigma = K)[1,]\n    \n    # central tendency\n    mu &lt;- epsilon_gp + eta\n    \n    # data prediction\n    y &lt;- rnorm(N, mu, sigma)\n      \n    tibble(x, eta, mu, y) \n  }\n\nplot_GP_simulation &lt;- function(GP_simulation) {\n  GP_simulation |&gt; \n    ggplot(aes(x = x, y = eta )) + \n    geom_line(color = project_colors[1], size = 1.25) +\n    geom_line(aes(y = mu), color = project_colors[2], size = 1.25) +\n    geom_point(aes(y = y), color = project_colors[3], alpha = 0.7, size = 1.2)\n}\n\n\nHere is an example:\n\n\nToggle code\nget_GP_simulation(\n  x = seq(-1,1, length.out = 500), \n  Intercept = 0, \n  slope = 0.3, \n  sigma_f = 0.05, \n  lambda  = 20, \n  sigma = 0.05) |&gt; \n  plot_GP_simulation()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blue line is a regular, simple linear regression line, the linear predictor part, if you will. The red line is the predictor of central tendency, obtained by overlaying the linear predictor with “wiggles” sampled from the Gaussian process. The yellow dots are actual samples (obtained from a normal distribution) around the central predictor line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing these functions get intuitions for the kinds of curves you generate for different input vectors and parameter constellations.\n\n\n\nCaveat. This generation script is a simplified procedural illustration of a Gaussian process regression (an intuition gym). The actual implementation of a Bayesian Gaussian process regression (e.g., in brms) is much more involved. Nevertheless, we can appreciate the most important idea: for a set of parameter values supplied to the function get_GP_simulation we get different wiggly regression lines. So, reverting this generative process (or one similar to it), we can ask: which parameter values are likely to have generated a set of \\(x,y\\) observations? And that is the simple and elegant idea behing Bayesian Gaussian process regression.\n\n\nGP regression in brms\nTo implement GP regression in brms (using a radial basis function kernel; the only kernel currently implemented), just need to specify gp() for the predictor for which we want “GP wiggles”, so to speak.\nIn practice, GPR can be slow and parameters hard to identify. Let’s therefore try a simple example of parameter recovery, keeping in mind that the underyling implementation in brms may be slightly different from the heuristic protocol used for intuition-building here. It will therefore be particularly interesting to see if we can recover the intercept and slope of the generating model, i.e., the “linear core” from which we are most likely to draw relevant conclusions eventually (e.g., is there a main (linear) effect of factor XYZ underneath the wiggliness).\n\n\nToggle code\nGP_simulation &lt;- get_GP_simulation(\n  x = seq(-1,1, length.out = 100), \n  Intercept = 0, \n  slope = 1, \n  sigma_f = 0.5, \n  lambda  = 2, \n  sigma = 0.0001,\n  seed = 1996)\n\nplot_GP_simulation(GP_simulation)\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the GP-regression model in brms:\n\n\nToggle code\n# results: hide\nfit_GPR &lt;- \n  brms::brm(\n    formula = y ~ gp(x) + x,\n    data    = GP_simulation,\n    iter    = 4000\n  )\n\n\nIt seems that we have recoverd the “linear core” parameters reasonably well, even if the estimates of the other parameter diverge from those we used to create the data (which is because the data-generating models are actually different).\n\n\nToggle code\nsummary(fit_GPR)\n\n\n Family: gaussian \n  Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity \nFormula: y ~ gp(x) + x \n   Data: GP_simulation (Number of observations: 100) \n  Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 4000; warmup = 2000; thin = 1;\n         total post-warmup draws = 8000\n\nGaussian Process Terms: \n            Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsdgp(gpx)       0.44      0.08     0.31     0.61 1.01      870      862\nlscale(gpx)     0.03      0.00     0.02     0.04 1.01      353      338\n\nPopulation-Level Effects: \n          Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nIntercept     0.07      0.11    -0.15     0.29 1.00     3021     2846\nx             1.16      0.20     0.78     1.57 1.00     1808     1002\n\nFamily Specific Parameters: \n      Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsigma     0.21      0.02     0.17     0.25 1.00     1993     2464\n\nDraws were sampled using sampling(NUTS).

    "text": "Multi-membership models are useful in cases where group-level effects are plausible but elements do not necessarily belong just to a single group. For example, if we want to include group-level effects for the native language (of participants in an experiment), some individuals may have more than one. Individuals with more than one native language would belong to multiple groups, whence the term multi-membership models. Moreover, there are cases where membership in a group is a matter of degree: if a grouping of individuals is by “country of residence”, for example, some people might spend variable amounts of time in different countries, and our model may want to account for that.\n\nPreamble\nHere is code to load (and if necessary, install) required packages, and to set some global options (for plotting and efficient fitting of Bayesian models).\n\n\nToggle code\n# install packages from CRAN (unless installed)\npckgs_needed &lt;- c(\n  \"tidyverse\",\n  \"brms\",\n  \"rstan\",\n  \"rstanarm\",\n  \"remotes\",\n  \"tidybayes\",\n  \"bridgesampling\",\n  \"shinystan\",\n  \"mgcv\"\n)\npckgs_installed &lt;- installed.packages()[,\"Package\"]\npckgs_2_install &lt;- pckgs_needed[!(pckgs_needed %in% pckgs_installed)]\nif(length(pckgs_2_install)) {\n  install.packages(pckgs_2_install)\n} \n\n# install additional packages from GitHub (unless installed)\nif (! \"aida\" %in% pckgs_installed) {\n  remotes::install_github(\"michael-franke/aida-package\")\n}\nif (! \"faintr\" %in% pckgs_installed) {\n  remotes::install_github(\"michael-franke/faintr\")\n}\nif (! \"cspplot\" %in% pckgs_installed) {\n  remotes::install_github(\"CogSciPrag/cspplot\")\n}\n\n# load the required packages\nx &lt;- lapply(pckgs_needed, library, character.only = TRUE)\nlibrary(aida)\nlibrary(faintr)\nlibrary(cspplot)\n\n# these options help Stan run faster\noptions(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())\n\n# use the CSP-theme for plotting\ntheme_set(theme_csp())\n\n# global color scheme from CSP\nproject_colors = cspplot::list_colors() |&gt; pull(hex)\n# names(project_colors) &lt;- cspplot::list_colors() |&gt; pull(name)\n\n# setting theme colors globally\nscale_colour_discrete &lt;- function(...) {\n  scale_colour_manual(..., values = project_colors)\n}\nscale_fill_discrete &lt;- function(...) {\n   scale_fill_manual(..., values = project_colors)\n}\n\n\n\n\nMulti-membership group-level effects\nTo understand multi-membership models, consider first a normal (non-multi-membership) group-level modeling approach. Say that each observation \\(i\\) belongs to exactly one of \\(k\\) categories \\(c(i) \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}\\). A group-level intercept consists of a vector of additive offsets \\(\\vec{u} = \\langle u_{1}, \\dots, u_{k} \\rangle\\), one adjustment \\(u_{i}\\) for each category \\(i\\). The linear predictor for observation \\(i\\) is computed by adding the appropriate group-level offset to the population-level intercept, like so:\n\\[\n\\eta_i = \\beta_0 + u_{c(i)} + \\dots\n\\]\nInstead of an indexing function \\(c(i)\\), which returns the category index for each observation \\(i\\), this can also be written using a one-hot vector encoding. Let, \\(\\vec{\\delta}_i\\) be a vector of length \\(k\\) which contains only zeros, except in position \\(c(i)\\), where it contains a 1. Then we can equivalently write the equation for the linear predictor term as:\n\\[\n\\eta_i = \\beta_0 + \\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{\\delta}_i + \\dots\n\\]\nFor example, if there are only four categories, and if observation \\(i\\) belongs to the third category (\\(c(i)=3\\)), we have \\(\\delta_i = \\langle 0,0,1,0 \\rangle\\), so that the dot product \\(\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{\\delta}_i\\) will just return the value of \\(\\vec{u}\\) at position 3.\nFrom here, it’s just one step further to a multi-membership model. Instead of a one-hot vector encoding for group-membership, consider a vector of (normalized) weights \\(\\vec{w}_i\\) given the relative degree to which observation \\(i\\) belongs to each category. The linear predictor is then:\n\\[\n\\eta_i = \\beta_0 + \\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{w}_i + \\dots\n\\]\nand that’s all to it. Similar considerations apply to random slopes.\nImportantly, the weights \\(\\vec{w}_i\\) are given (from observation). (I am not aware that brms allows to estimate the weights as well. If that would be a requirement, directly coding the model in Stan might be necessary.)\n\n\nSimulated data set of multi-membership effects\nTo explore how a multi-membership model can recover the true effects of weighted membership, we use a simulated data set based on a vanilla linear regression (with one predictor term). The true population-level parameters are:\n\n\nToggle code\n# true parameters (population-level)\npop_Intercept = 3\npop_Slope     = 2\npop_SD        = 1\n\n\nFor group-level effects, assume that there are five groups. Each has a true additive offset (random intercept) as follows:\n\n\nToggle code\n# true parameters (group-level):\n# - there are five groups\n# - random intercepts for each group\n#   -&gt; sequence -0.8 -0.4  0.0  0.4  0.8\ngroup_Intercepts = seq(from = -0.8, to = 0.8, length.out = 5)\n\n\nHere are samples from a model, in which each individual observation (each row) can belong to variable degree to one of two groups.\n\n\nToggle code\nn_samples = 2000\ndata_multiMember &lt;- \n  tibble(\n    x     = rnorm(n_samples), \n    g1    = sample(1:5, n_samples, TRUE), \n    g2    = sample(1:5, n_samples, TRUE),\n    y_pop = rnorm(n_samples, mean = pop_Slope * x + pop_Intercept),\n    w1    = rbeta(n_samples, 1, 1),\n    w2    = 1 - w1,\n    RE    = group_Intercepts[g1] * w1 + group_Intercepts[g2] * w2,\n    y     = y_pop + RE\n  )\n\n\nThis plot shows the simulated data, where the points in blue show the actual observations, and the points in yellow show the data before applying the group-level effects.\n\n\nToggle code\n# unperturbed data in yellow, observed data in blue \ndata_multiMember |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x,y)) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = x ,y = y_pop), color = project_colors[3], alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_point(color = project_colors[1], alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo run a multi-membership model in brms, there is special syntax for the group-level effects. Writing + (1 | mm(g1, g2)) indicates random intercepts for multi-membership as indicated by the vectors g1 and g2. Without further information, this is interpreted as belonging equally to each group (weights 0.5 for each, if we have two possible group memberships). If membership is weighted, as indicated in our data set in columns w1 and w2, this can be expressed as: + ( 1 | mm(g1, g2, weights = cbind(w1, w2)). (NB: the weights argument expects a matrix, so that we need to include cbind() here.)\n\n\nToggle code\n# multi-membership model with two members per group and equal weights\nfit_mm &lt;- \n  brms::brm(\n    formula = y ~ x + ( 1 | mm(g1, g2, weights = cbind(w1, w2))), \n    data    = data_multiMember,\n    control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99)\n    )\n\n\nDid the model recover the true group-level intercepts?

Concretely, add bias to the sampling of variables g1 and g2, making it more likely for g1 to be a lower rather than higher indexed group, and reversely for g2. Also, add a bias in the weights towards g1 by changing the shape parameters of the Beta distribution. This should induce an overall bias towards random intercepts that lower the linear predictor.\nPlot the new data using the previous plotting code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle code\nn_samples = 2000\ndata_multiMember &lt;- \n  tibble(\n    x     = rnorm(n_samples), \n    g1    = sample(1:5, n_samples, TRUE, prob = 5:1), \n    g2    = sample(1:5, n_samples, TRUE, prob = 1:5),\n    y_pop = rnorm(n_samples, mean = pop_Slope * x + pop_Intercept),\n    w1    = rbeta(n_samples, 4, 1),\n    w2    = 1 - w1,\n    RE    = group_Intercepts[g1] * w1 + group_Intercepts[g2] * w2,\n    y     = y_pop + RE\n  )\n\n\n\n\nToggle code\n# unperturbed data in yellow, observed data in blue \ndata_multiMember |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x,y)) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = x ,y = y_pop), color = project_colors[3], alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_point(color = project_colors[1], alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1b: Check parameter recovery\n\n\n\n\n\nFit a multi-membership model to the new data and check if group-level parameters are recoverable still. How do you interpret the results: did the model recover the true parameters or not?\n[If you want: Think about what influences recoverability.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle code\n# multi-membership model with two members per group and equal weights\nfit_mm &lt;- \n  brms::brm(\n    formula = y ~ x + ( 1 | mm(g1, g2, weights = cbind(w1, w2)) ), \n    data    = data_multiMember,\n    control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99)\n    )\ntidybayes::summarise_draws(fit_mm) |&gt; \n  filter(grepl(\"r_\",variable)) |&gt; \n  select(variable, q5, mean, q95)\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n  variable                   q5    mean    q95\n  &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;num&gt;   &lt;num&gt;  &lt;num&gt;\n1 r_mmg1g2[1,Intercept] -1.53   -0.839  -0.170\n2 r_mmg1g2[2,Intercept] -1.13   -0.434   0.221\n3 r_mmg1g2[3,Intercept] -0.639   0.0550  0.729\n4 r_mmg1g2[4,Intercept] -0.279   0.419   1.10 \n5 r_mmg1g2[5,Intercept]  0.0371  0.724   1.40 \n\n\nThe recovery is not as immaculate as without the bias, but it is still okay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1c: Compare multi-membership model to vanilla\n\n\n\n\n\nRun a vanilla regression model for the biased data, i.e., without group-level effects. Compare the models based on a simple posterior predictive check with pp_check(). What do you conclude from this?\nCompare the models based on their posterior predicitive adequacy, e.g., using LOO model comparison (if you can; maybe you have not learned about this yet). Interpret the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle code\nfit_vanilla &lt;- \n  brms::brm(\n    formula = y ~ x, \n    data    = data_multiMember\n  )\n\npp_check(fit_mm)\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle code\npp_check(fit_vanilla)\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle code\nloo_compare(loo(fit_mm), loo(fit_vanilla))\n\n\n            elpd_diff se_diff\nfit_mm         0.0       0.0 \nfit_vanilla -179.1      17.8 \n\n\nThe visual PPC does not distinguish between these models (because it is sensitive only to the overal distribution of the response variable).\nThe LOO-based model comparison is more informative: The vanilla model appears to be substantially worse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you think of an example from your own line of work where multi-membership group-level effects might be plausible, possibly even mandatory?"

    "section": "Dummy (Treatment) Coding",
    "text": "Dummy (Treatment) Coding\nDummy coding, or treatment coding, is the default coding scheme used by R. Understanding the name ‘treatment coding’ helps understanding what this coding scheme does: imagine a medical experiment with a single control group (who obtain a placebo) and different experimental groups each of which gets a different treatment (e.g., different drugs), and where we want to compare each treatment group to the single, pivotal control group. Consequently, dummy coded variables are estimated by comparing all levels of the variable to a reference level. The intercept of a linear model containing dummy-coded variables is the mean of the reference level.\nOur variables only have two levels, so the effect of gender could be estimated by treating female as the reference level and estimating the effect of being male compared to the reference level – so basically estimating the difference in pitch it takes to “get from female to male”. Similarly, we can estimate the effect of context: the informal context can be treated as the reference level and the effect of politeness can be estimated against it. By default, the first level of a factor is treated as the reference level (for unordered factors that is the first string in alphanumeric order) - but principally, there is no difference as to which level should be used as the reference level. It makes sense to choose the level which is in some sense the ‘control’ in your experimental design.\nBecause R uses dummy-coding by default, we can look at the default numerical coding right away. The function contrasts() displays the contrast matrix for the respective variable:\n\n\nToggle code\ncontrasts(politeness_df$gender)\n\n\n  M\nF 0\nM 1\n\n\nToggle code\ncontrasts(politeness_df$context)\n\n\n    pol\ninf   0\npol   1\n\n\nBut if we wish to explicitly assign a dummy (treatment) coding to a variable, we may do so by a built-in R function.\n\n\nToggle code\ncontrasts(politeness_df$gender) &lt;- contr.treatment(n=2) # insert the number of levels here\ncolnames(contrasts(politeness_df$gender)) &lt;- \"M\" # manually declare the contrast level names\n\n\nSo both variables \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) can take either the value 0 or 1 (because we dummy-code both categorical variables; see below for more). We already defined the referenc levels of the single variables, now we can define the overall reference level of our model (by combining the two individual reference levels) – it is the mean pitch of female speakers in informal contexts.\nHaving set all the basics, we can now turn to computing a linear model of the mean pitch as predicted by the factors gender and context:\n\n\nToggle code\n# here, we only use fixed effects\nfit_dummy_FE &lt;- brm(\n  pitch ~ gender * context,\n  data = politeness_df,\n  cores = 4,\n  iter = 1000\n)\n\n\n\n\nToggle code\nfit_dummy_FE.coefs &lt;- fixef(fit_dummy_FE)[,1] %&gt;% as.numeric() # get the estimated coefficients\nsummary(fit_dummy_FE)\n\n\n Family: gaussian \n  Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity \nFormula: pitch ~ gender * context \n   Data: politeness_df (Number of observations: 83) \n  Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 1000; warmup = 500; thin = 1;\n         total post-warmup draws = 2000\n\nPopulation-Level Effects: \n                   Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nIntercept            260.59      7.81   245.22   276.15 1.00     1205     1092\ngenderM             -115.80     11.28  -137.56   -93.20 1.01     1077     1317\ncontextpol           -27.08     10.76   -47.75    -5.39 1.00     1040     1149\ngenderM:contextpol    15.32     15.64   -16.41    45.48 1.00     1013     1277\n\nFamily Specific Parameters: \n      Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsigma    36.12      2.92    30.98    42.44 1.00     1762     1408\n\nDraws were sampled using sampling(NUTS). For each parameter, Bulk_ESS\nand Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential\nscale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).\n\n\nNow how do we interpret the estimated coefficients?\nLet us recall the regression equation that is hidden behind this output: \\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*x_1 + \\beta_2*x_2 + \\beta_3*x_1x_2\\]\nIn order to help us interpret the output, R assigns string names to the estimated coefficients using the names we used in the generic formula. The (Intercept) corresponds to \\(\\beta_0\\), genderM corresponds to \\(\\beta_1\\), contextpol corresponds to \\(\\beta_2\\) and genderM:contextpol (the interaction term) to \\(\\beta_3\\).\nFurther, let us recall the numerical coding of our variables: for \\(x_1\\) (gender) a 0 means female, a 1 means male; for \\(x_2\\) (context) a 0 means informal, a 1 means polite. So the computed values are the estimates for conditions differing from the respective reference conditions - i.e. when the respective \\(x\\) is a 1.\nTo get an estimate of a certain design cell (\\(y_i\\)) - let’s start with the mean pitch of female speakers (0 for \\(x_1\\)) in informal contexts (0 for \\(x_2\\)) - we just insert the corresponding numeric values for the corresponding \\(x\\) and the estimated value for the corresponding \\(\\beta\\). Thus we get:\n\n\nToggle code\ny1 = fit_dummy_FE.coefs[1] + fit_dummy_FE.coefs[2]*0 +\n  fit_dummy_FE.coefs[3]*0 + fit_dummy_FE.coefs[4]*(0)\ny1\n\n\n[1] 260.5866\n\n\nHence, the mean pitch of female speakers in informal context corresponds to the intercept. As a sanity check, we can recall that for dummy coded variables the model intercept is just the mean of the reference cell (in our case, female speakers in informal contexts!).\nLet’s now calculate the mean pitch of male speakers (1 for \\(x_1\\)) in informal contexts (0 for \\(x_2\\)):\n\n\nToggle code\ny2 = fit_dummy_FE.coefs[1] + fit_dummy_FE.coefs[2]*1 +\n  fit_dummy_FE.coefs[3]*0 + fit_dummy_FE.coefs[4]*(1*0)\ny2\n\n\n[1] 144.782\n\n\n\nQuantifying uncertainty\nThe previous estimate of the cell mean used the mean estimate for model paramters. This way, we get no information about the uncertainty in this estimate.

    "text": "Simple (Contrast) Coding\nAnother common coding scheme is the simple coding (also called contrast coding). Simple coded variables are also compared to a reference level (just like dummy-coded ones). However, the intercept of a simple coded model is the grand mean – the mean of all cells (i.e. the mean of female-informal & female-polite & male-informal & male-polite cells).\nGenerally, this kind of coding can be created by subtracting \\(1/k\\) from the dummy coding contrast matrix, where \\(k\\) is the number of levels a variable has (in our case, both have two). Hence, the reference level will always only have negative values in the contrast matrix. The general rule is that the contrasts within a column have to add up to 0. R does not provide a built-in function for simple coding, but we can easily create the respective matrix ourselves by subtracting \\(1/k\\) (i.e. 1/2) from the dummy coding matrix:\n\n\nToggle code\n# manual creation of contrasts\ncontr.matrix &lt;- matrix( rep(0.5, 2))\ndummy.matrix &lt;- contr.treatment(2)\ncontr.coding &lt;- dummy.matrix - contr.matrix\n\n# we should duplicate the values to not overwrite previous contrasts\npoliteness_df &lt;- politeness_df %&gt;%\n  mutate(context_contr = context,\n         gender_contr = gender)\ncontrasts(politeness_df$context_contr) &lt;- contr.coding\ncontrasts(politeness_df$gender_contr)  &lt;- contr.coding\n\n\nHence now the gender is coded as -0.5 for female and 0.5 for male; context is coded as -0.5 for informal and 0.5 for polite.\nLet’s again look at our regression model:\n\n\nToggle code\nlm.contr.FE &lt;- brm(\n  pitch ~ gender_contr * context_contr,\n  data = politeness_df,\n  cores = 4,\n  iter =  1000\n)\n\n\n\n\nToggle code\nlm.contr.FE.coefs &lt;- fixef(lm.contr.FE)[,1] %&gt;% as.numeric() # get vector of estimated coefficients\nsummary(lm.contr.FE)\n\n\n Family: gaussian \n  Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity \nFormula: pitch ~ gender_contr * context_contr \n   Data: politeness_df (Number of observations: 83) \n  Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 1000; warmup = 500; thin = 1;\n         total post-warmup draws = 2000\n\nPopulation-Level Effects: \n                             Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS\nIntercept                      192.87      4.02   185.29   200.91 1.01     2511\ngender_contr2                 -108.33      8.58  -125.10   -91.86 1.00     2818\ncontext_contr2                 -19.45      7.82   -34.34    -4.17 1.00     2245\ngender_contr2:context_contr2    15.81     15.81   -15.14    48.10 1.00     2413\n                             Tail_ESS\nIntercept                        1137\ngender_contr2                    1477\ncontext_contr2                   1152\ngender_contr2:context_contr2     1403\n\nFamily Specific Parameters: \n      Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsigma    36.16      2.93    30.94    42.44 1.01     2230     1542\n\nDraws were sampled using sampling(NUTS).

The estimate of e.g. the context effect now denotes the value by which the mean pitch in informal (estimate * 1, remember our coding!) or polite contexts (estimate * -1) differs from the grand mean. So if we wish to calculate the mean pitch in polite contexts (across genders), we would do:\n\n\nToggle code\nyPol = lm.dev.FE.coefs[1] + lm.dev.FE.coefs[2] * (-1)\nyPol\n\n\n[1] 183.1552\n\n\nThis means that the single estimates are in some sense ‘independent’ of each other (in contrast to e.g. dummy-coded variables where the estimates are bound to the reference levels of two variables) and give us insight if a specific factor is credibly different from 0. Similarly, if we wish to calculate the mean pitch of male speakers, we would calculate:\n\n\nToggle code\nyM = lm.dev.FE.coefs[1] + lm.dev.FE.coefs[3] * (-1)\nyM\n\n\n[1] 138.8332"

    "text": "Mixing Coding Schemes\nIf you have several categorical predictor variables, it is also possible (and often useful!) to use different coding schemes for the different variables. It might, for example, make sense to use dummy coding for a variable which has a control and a treatment condition, and to use e.g. simple coding for a variable which has two ‘equal’ levels.\nFor example, we could use dummy-coding for context and simple-coding for gender.\nWhen you mix coding schemes or define your own schemes there might be no pre-defined answers to questions as to what the sigle coefficients or the intercept mean. But knowing how the different schemes work, you can easily find this out!\nLet us explore how the interpretation of the model changes if we mix coding schemes:\n\n\nToggle code\nlm.mixedCode.FE &lt;- brm(pitch ~ context * gender_contr,\n                data = politeness_df,\n                cores = 4,\n                iter = 1000)\n\n\n{lm.mixedCode.FE.coefs &lt;- fixef(lm.mixedCode.FE)[,1] %&gt;% as.numeric()} summary(lm.mixedCode.FE)\nGenerally, the interpretation is just the combination of what we have learned about the individual coding schemes. Recall that the intercept of a dummy-coded model is the mean of the reference level – since we dummy-coded context, the refernce level would be informal context. But it is not the intercept yet! We have the second predictor in our model – the simple coded gender. In simple coded models the intercept is the mean across the levels of the variable. Now the intercept of our model with the two different predictors is the mean pitch in informal contexts - across genders.\nFollowing this logic, the context estimate denotes the difference between the informal and polite contexts - still across genders. The gender estimate denoted the difference between the mean pitch and female speakers if multiplied by the value -0.5 (recall our coding above); and the mean pitch and male speakers if multiplied by the value 0.5."

The only difference to our old data set is that now we need two numeric variables coding the contrasts between the levels of one variable.

Again there is a reference level - List 1 - described by \\(x_{1_2}\\) and \\(x_{1_3}\\) being 0. \\(x_{1_2}\\) being 1 describes the difference between the reference level and List 2; \\(x_{1_3}\\) being 1 describes the difference between the reference level and List 3. Correspondingly, there is and individual \\(\\beta\\) for each numeric variable estimated in the regression model. The coding of the SOA factor works just the same way.

For fine-grained plotting and exploring, the bayesplot package offers flexible plotting tools. These come in pairs: predicitve distributions only show the predictions, while predictive checks also show the data. See help(\"PPC-overview\") and help(\"PPD-overview\") for more information.\nThe general workflow is that you first extract samples from the relevant predictive distribution (in matrix form), like so:\n\n\nToggle code\npredictive_samples &lt;- brms::posterior_predict(fit_posterior, ndraws = 1000)\npredictive_samples[1:5, 1:5] \n\n\n         [,1]     [,2]     [,3]     [,4]     [,5]\n[1,] 7.290106 7.186029 7.127800 7.350256 7.732647\n[2,] 7.296884 7.928648 8.305388 7.906626 6.902459\n[3,] 6.699144 7.571900 7.366700 7.271956 7.237721\n[4,] 7.535805 7.982334 7.855659 7.705991 7.435827\n[5,] 7.453267 7.650705 8.011097 7.745332 6.177479\n\n\nAnd then you can, for example, compare the distribution of some test statistic (here: the standard deviation), using a function like ppc_stat:\n\n\nToggle code\nbayesplot::ppc_stat(\n  y    = aida::data_WorldTemp$avg_temp, \n  yrep = predictive_samples,\n  stat = sd)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpret this plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe light blue histogram indicates the distribution of the values of the test statistics under the predictive distribution (here: posterior). The darker blue line indicates the value of the test statistic for the observed data.\nIn this case, the observed test value is rather central in the posterior predictive distribution, thus suggesting that, as far as the standard deviation is concerned, the model cannot be criticized for its posterior predictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\n\n\n\n\n\nTry a similar ppc_stat plot for the prior predictive.

Requiring that mu be ordered, breaks this symmetry."

As a running example, we look at the linear relation between (aggregates of) area-under-the-curve AUC and MAD. Here is the relevant data plot:\n\n\nToggle code\n# catchy name for the data\ndolphin &lt;- aida::data_MT\n\n# create aggregate data\ndolphin_agg &lt;- dolphin |&gt; \n  filter(correct == 1) |&gt; \n  group_by(subject_id) |&gt; \n  dplyr::summarize(\n    AUC = median(AUC, na.rm = TRUE),\n    MAD = median(MAD, na.rm = TRUE))\n\ndolphin_agg |&gt; \nggplot(aes(x = MAD, y = AUC)) + \n  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.3) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle code\n# run the model\nmodel1 = brm(\n  AUC ~ MAD, \n  data = dolphin_agg)\n\n\n\n\nInspect & change priors\nWe can inspect the priors used in in a model fit like so:\n\n\nToggle code\nbrms::prior_summary(model1)\n\n\n                          prior     class coef group resp dpar nlpar lb ub\n student_t(3, 14864.2, 32772.3) Intercept                                 \n                         (flat)         b                                 \n                         (flat)         b  MAD                            \n       student_t(3, 0, 32772.3)     sigma                             0   \n       source\n      default\n      default\n (vectorized)\n      default\n\n\nThe table gives information about the kind of prior used for different parameters. Parameters are classified into different classes (column “class”). The “b” class contains the slope coeffiecients. Here, we only have one slope (for MAD), which is identified in the “coef” column. For more complex models, the other colums may be important (e.g., identifying groups in multi-level models, for parameters in distributional and non-linear models, as well as lower and upper bounded paramters).\nThis particular output tells us that the priors for the slope coefficient for the variable MAD was “flat”. Per default, brms uses so-called improper priors for slope coefficients, i.e., not specifying any prior at all, so that every parameter value is equally weighted (even if this is not a proper probability distribution since the support is infinite).\nIn contrast, brms /does/ use more specific, in fact rather smart, priors for the intercept and for the standard deviation. These priors are informed by the data. Look:\n\n\nToggle code\ndolphin_agg |&gt; pull(AUC) |&gt; median()\n\n\n[1] 14864.25\n\n\nToggle code\ndolphin_agg |&gt; pull(AUC) |&gt; sd()\n\n\n[1] 49258.31\n\n\nWe can change the priors used to fit the model with the prior attribute and the brms::prior() function. Here, we set it to a normal (with ridiculously small standard deviation).\n\n\nToggle code\nmodel2 &lt;- brm(\n  AUC ~ MAD, \n  data = dolphin_agg,\n  prior = brms::prior(normal(0,10), class = \"b\")\n)\n\n\nThe brms::prior() function expects the prior to be specified as a Stan expression. Full documentation of the available functions for priors is in the Stan Functions Reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1a\n\n\n\n\n\nFit a third model model3 as the previous ones, but set the prior for the slope coefficient to a Student’s \\(t\\) distribution with mean 0, standard deviation 100 and one degree of freedom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle code\nmodel3 &lt;- brm(\n  AUC ~ MAD, \n  data = dolphin_agg,\n  prior = brms::prior(student_t(1,0,100), class = \"b\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1b\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare the mean posteriors for all three main parameters (intercept, slope for MAD and sigma) in all three models. What effect did changing the prior on the slope parameter have for models 2 and 3? Remember that the priors for these models are quite “unreasonable” in the sense that they are far away from the posterior obtained for model 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle code\nextract_info &lt;- function(model_fit, label) {\n  tidybayes::summarise_draws(model_fit) |&gt; \n    mutate(model = label) |&gt; \n    select(model, variable, q5, mean, q95) |&gt; \n    filter(variable %in% c('b_Intercept', 'b_MAD', 'sigma'))\n}\n\nrbind(\n  extract_info(model1, \"model 1\"),\n  extract_info(model2, \"model 2\"),\n  extract_info(model3, \"model 3\")\n) |&gt; arrange(variable, model)\n\n\n# A tibble: 9 × 5\n  model   variable          q5    mean     q95\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;num&gt;   &lt;num&gt;   &lt;num&gt;\n1 model 1 b_Intercept -2685.     465.   3491. \n2 model 2 b_Intercept 14960.   22212.  29436. \n3 model 3 b_Intercept -2551.     517.   3578. \n4 model 1 b_MAD         428.     455.    482. \n5 model 2 b_MAD           5.79    22.0    38.0\n6 model 3 b_MAD         428.     454.    482. \n7 model 1 sigma       15388.   17193.  19267. \n8 model 2 sigma       42085.   47338.  53323. \n9 model 3 sigma       15362.   17178.  19233. \n\n\nWe see that the Student-t prior in model 3 gives a very similar fit as for model 1. This is likely due to the heavier tails of the Student-t distribution.\nWe also see that the more restricted model 2 has a much lower mean posterior for the slope coefficient (because this parameter is “leashed close to zero” by the prior). Instead, model 2 compensates with a much higher intercept estimate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe important upshot of this exercise is that since all parameters jointly condition the likelihood function, it can happen that changing the priors for just one parameter will also affect the posterior inferences for other parameters (who have to “go out of their way” to compensate for what the other parameter can or cannot do, so to speak).\nThis raises the question of how to determine “good priors”. This is a chapter of its own, and a controversial one, and definitely a matter that depends on what you want to do with your model (explore or monkey-around, make serious predictions about the future (e.g., disease spread, market development), or draw theoretical conclusions from data (e.g., which theory of reading-times in garden-path sentences is supported better by some data)). In almost all cases, however, it is good advice to remember this: priors should be evaluated in the context of the (prior) predictions they entail. That’s the topic we attend to in the next section.\n\n\nSample from prior\nBefore going there, here is how we can obtain samples from the prior distribution over parameters of a model. Sampling from the prior only works if priors are not the improper (flat) default priors. Firstly, we can use the option sample_prior = \"only\" to obtain only samples from the prior. (NB: we still need to supply the data because it is used for the setting up the model; e.g., specifying the prior for the intercept.)\n\n\nToggle code\nmodel2_priorOnly &lt;- brm(\n  AUC ~ MAD, \n  data = dolphin_agg,\n  prior = brms::prior(normal(0,10), class = \"b\"),\n  sample_prior = 'only'\n)\n\n\n\n\nToggle code\nmodel2_priorOnly |&gt; tidybayes::summarise_draws() |&gt; select(1:6)\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 6\n  variable         mean      median       sd      mad       q5\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;num&gt;       &lt;num&gt;    &lt;num&gt;    &lt;num&gt;    &lt;num&gt;\n1 b_Intercept 14717.    14813.      73087.   37719.   -61413. \n2 b_MAD          -0.134    -0.00763    10.1     10.1     -16.8\n3 sigma       35757.    25675.      39130.   23083.     2453. \n4 lprior        -27.4     -26.9         1.74     1.36    -30.7\n5 lp__          -17.4     -17.0         1.63     1.31    -20.4\n\n\nIt is also possible to obtain a posterior fit /and/ prior samples at the same time, but that is a bit more fickle, as the prior samples will have other names, and (AFAICS) other functions are required than for posterior samples, entailing other formatting of the returned samples.\n\n\nToggle code\nmodel2_priorAdded &lt;- brm(\n  AUC ~ MAD, \n  data = dolphin_agg,\n  prior = brms::prior(normal(0,10), class = \"b\"),\n  sample_prior = TRUE\n)\n\n\n\n\nToggle code\n# posterior samples\nmodel2_priorAdded |&gt; tidybayes::summarise_draws() |&gt; select(1:6)\n\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 6\n  variable              mean     median       sd       mad        q5\n  &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;num&gt;      &lt;num&gt;    &lt;num&gt;     &lt;num&gt;     &lt;num&gt;\n1 b_Intercept     22311.     22271.      4515.    4603.     15071.  \n2 b_MAD              21.7       21.6       10.2     10.4        4.87\n3 sigma           47382.     47221.      3393.    3361.     42084.  \n4 prior_Intercept 15349.     14059.     55660.   39814.    -60965.  \n5 prior_b            -0.0959     0.0351    10.1     10.2      -17.0 \n6 prior_sigma     37971.     25452.     45590.   23776.      2050.  \n7 lprior            -29.3      -28.8        2.31     2.07     -33.7 \n8 lp__            -1335.     -1334.         1.21     0.981  -1337.  \n\n\nToggle code\n# prior samples\nbrms::prior_samples(model2_priorAdded) |&gt; summary()\n\n\n   Intercept             b                 sigma         \n Min.   :-558085   Min.   :-40.40793   Min.   :     1.2  \n 1st Qu.: -11931   1st Qu.: -6.83035   1st Qu.: 12027.3  \n Median :  14059   Median :  0.03513   Median : 25452.1  \n Mean   :  15349   Mean   : -0.09590   Mean   : 37971.3  \n 3rd Qu.:  41601   3rd Qu.:  6.89005   3rd Qu.: 48406.1  \n Max.   : 486243   Max.   : 31.14966   Max.   :677048.6  \n\n\nA third possibility is to use stats::update() to draw additional prior samples from an already fitted object, like so:\n\n\nToggle code\n# this fit only contains priors but keeps them with the same names and structure\n# as the posterior samples in `model2`\nmodel2_priorUpdate &lt;- stats::update(model2, sample_prior = \"only\")\n\n\n\n\nToggle code\nmodel2_priorUpdate |&gt; tidybayes::summarise_draws() |&gt; select(1:6)\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 6\n  variable         mean    median       sd      mad       q5\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;num&gt;     &lt;num&gt;    &lt;num&gt;    &lt;num&gt;    &lt;num&gt;\n1 b_Intercept 15002.    15430.    69846.   38872.   -68581. \n2 b_MAD           0.360     0.491    10.1      9.97    -16.2\n3 sigma       36695.    24807.    41620.   24104.     1969. \n4 lprior        -27.5     -27.0       1.80     1.41    -30.9\n5 lp__          -17.5     -17.1       1.67     1.32    -20.7"

    "text": "The term “distributional model” is not sharply defined and not altogether common. Alternatively, one may read “models for location, scale and shape” or similar verbiage. The general idea, however, is simple: when our model has a likelihood function with additional parameters, e.g., the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) in the Gaussian likelihood function of a vanilla linear regression, we can not only infer these parameters, but also make them dependent, e.g., on other predictors.\nFor example, when a standard linear regression model would look like this:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny & \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma) \\\\\n\\mu & = X \\ \\beta \\\\\n\\beta, \\sigma & \\sim \\dots \\text{some priors} \\dots\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\na simple distributional model could look like this:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny & \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma) \\\\\n\\mu & = X \\ \\beta^{\\mu} \\\\\n\\sigma & = \\exp \\left ( X \\ \\beta^{\\sigma} \\right) \\\\\n\\beta^{\\mu}, \\beta^{\\sigma} & \\sim \\dots \\text{some priors} \\dots\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nthereby assuming that \\(\\sigma\\) itself depends on the predictors \\(X\\) in a linear way.\n\nPreamble\nHere is code to load (and if necessary, install) required packages, and to set some global options (for plotting and efficient fitting of Bayesian models).\n\n\nToggle code\n# install packages from CRAN (unless installed)\npckgs_needed &lt;- c(\n  \"tidyverse\",\n  \"brms\",\n  \"rstan\",\n  \"rstanarm\",\n  \"remotes\",\n  \"tidybayes\",\n  \"bridgesampling\",\n  \"shinystan\",\n  \"mgcv\"\n)\npckgs_installed &lt;- installed.packages()[,\"Package\"]\npckgs_2_install &lt;- pckgs_needed[!(pckgs_needed %in% pckgs_installed)]\nif(length(pckgs_2_install)) {\n  install.packages(pckgs_2_install)\n} \n\n# install additional packages from GitHub (unless installed)\nif (! \"aida\" %in% pckgs_installed) {\n  remotes::install_github(\"michael-franke/aida-package\")\n}\nif (! \"faintr\" %in% pckgs_installed) {\n  remotes::install_github(\"michael-franke/faintr\")\n}\nif (! \"cspplot\" %in% pckgs_installed) {\n  remotes::install_github(\"CogSciPrag/cspplot\")\n}\n\n# load the required packages\nx &lt;- lapply(pckgs_needed, library, character.only = TRUE)\nlibrary(aida)\nlibrary(faintr)\nlibrary(cspplot)\n\n# these options help Stan run faster\noptions(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())\n\n# use the CSP-theme for plotting\ntheme_set(theme_csp())\n\n# global color scheme from CSP\nproject_colors = cspplot::list_colors() |&gt; pull(hex)\n# names(project_colors) &lt;- cspplot::list_colors() |&gt; pull(name)\n\n# setting theme colors globally\nscale_colour_discrete &lt;- function(...) {\n  scale_colour_manual(..., values = project_colors)\n}\nscale_fill_discrete &lt;- function(...) {\n   scale_fill_manual(..., values = project_colors)\n}\n\n\n\n\nExample: World temperature data\nThe World Temperature data, included in the aida package provides a useful minimal example. We want to regress avg_temp on year, but we see that early measurements appear to be much more noisy, so that a linear fit will be better for data between 1900 and 1980, and worse for data between 1750 to 1900, simply because of differences related to differently noise measurements at different times.\n\n\nToggle code\naida::data_WorldTemp |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_temp)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  ylab(\"average temperature\") + geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\nA simple linear regression model is easy to fit:\n\n\nToggle code\n# vanilla regression\nfit_temp_vanilla &lt;- \n  brms::brm(\n    avg_temp ~ year,\n    data = aida::data_WorldTemp)\n\n\nBut there are clear indicators that this is not a very good model, e.g., using a posterior predictive \\(p\\)-value with the standard deviation for predictions of all data points between 1750-1800 as a test statistic:\n\n\nToggle code\npostPred_y &lt;- \n  tidybayes::predicted_draws(\n    object  = fit_temp_vanilla,\n    newdata = aida::data_WorldTemp |&gt; dplyr::select(year) |&gt; filter(year &lt;= 1800),\n    value   = \"avg_temp\",\n    ndraws  = 4000) |&gt; ungroup() |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(.draw, year, avg_temp)\n\nsd_postPred &lt;- postPred_y |&gt; \n  group_by(.draw) |&gt; \n  summarize(sd_post_pred = sd(avg_temp)) |&gt; \n  pull(sd_post_pred)\n\nsd_data &lt;- aida::data_WorldTemp |&gt; filter(year &lt;= 1800) |&gt; pull(avg_temp) |&gt; sd()\n\nmean(sd_data &gt; sd_postPred)\n\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nIf we care about faithful prediction in this early period, including accuracy about the noisiness of the data, the vanilla linear model is clearly bad.\n\n\nA simple distributional model\nWe want to fit the distributional model sketched in the beginning:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny & \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma) \\\\\n\\mu & = X \\ \\beta^{\\mu} \\\\\n\\sigma & = \\exp \\left ( X \\ \\beta^{\\sigma} \\right) \\\\\n\\beta^{\\mu}, \\beta^{\\sigma} & \\sim \\dots \\text{some priors} \\dots\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nTo fit this model with brms, we need to specify the formula for the regression as follows:\n\n\nToggle code\nformula_temp_distributional = brms::bf(avg_temp ~ year, sigma ~ year)\n\n\nThis formula first declares that avg_temp is to be regressed on year, as usual, and also declares that sigma is supposed to be regressed (in quite the same way) on year as well. The variable sigma does not occur in the data, but is recognized as an internal variable, namely the standard deviation of the Gaussian likelihood function.\nSampling with Stan can get troublesome if parameters are on quite different scales, so we should make sure that the two estimands are roughly on the same scale.\n\n\nToggle code\n# to run a distributional model, we need to rescale 'year'\n#   division by a factor of 1000 is sufficient\ndata_WorldTemp &lt;- aida::data_WorldTemp |&gt; \n  mutate(year = (year)/1000)\n\n\n\n\nToggle code\nfit_temp_distributional &lt;- \n  brms::brm( \n    formula = brms::bf(avg_temp ~ year, sigma ~ year),\n    data    = data_WorldTemp\n  )\n\n\nThis model provides us with information about intercepts and slopes for both components, the regression of avg_temp and sigma.\n\n\nToggle code\nsummary(fit_temp_distributional)\n\n\n Family: gaussian \n  Links: mu = identity; sigma = log \nFormula: avg_temp ~ year \n         sigma ~ year\n   Data: data_WorldTemp (Number of observations: 269) \n  Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\n         total post-warmup draws = 4000\n\nPopulation-Level Effects: \n                Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nIntercept          -5.06      0.69    -6.43    -3.73 1.00     2821     2368\nsigma_Intercept     4.08      1.00     2.19     6.09 1.00     3052     2251\nyear                7.09      0.36     6.39     7.80 1.00     2845     2368\nsigma_year         -2.67      0.53    -3.73    -1.66 1.00     3046     2355\n\nDraws were sampled using sampling(NUTS).

    "text": "Resolving the puzzle by causal analysis\nYou say: “The data sets are not the same! The numbers are, but in one case we observed gender and in the other we observed blood pressure. That makes a difference, doesn’t it?”\nI say: “Well, okay, but not necessarily. Just having different labels for levels of a categorical variable doesn’t make for a different data set, does it?”\nBut you immediately shoot back: “Maybe, but you also told us about a difference in the data-generating process. There is at least a temporal difference: blood pressure is measured after the treatment, but the level of gender was fixed already before the treatment.”\n“Okay” I say. “So, do you suggest a temporal analysis?”\nYou roll your eyes and after a few more (ridiculous) turns of this conversation, we both agree that, at least conceptually speaking, there is a difference in the plausible causal structure of the involved variables.\nConsider the first case. There are three binary variables involved. Given the temporal sequence of events in the data-generating process, the likely causal relation between the variables is that gender may influence both drug (the decision to take the drug or not) and recovery. Moreover, the drug may have influenced recovery directly.\n\n\n\nCausal structure of scenario 1: gender is a confound\n\n\nNow consider the second scenario. Again, we have three binary variables. But since blood pressure is measured after the treatment, it is not plausible that it could have influenced the decision of whether to take the drug or not. Reversely, it is plausible to assume, i.e., to at least allow for the possibility, that blood pressure was affected by gender and that it may have affected recovery. As before, we also make room for the possibility that drug may affect recovery also directly.\n\n\n\nCausal structure of scenario 2: blood pressure is a mediator"

    "text": "Case 1: Gender as a confound\nSince the set \\(\\{G\\}\\) statisfies the backdoor criterion for the assumed causal DAG, we know that we can calculate the total causal effect (TCE) by eliminating the do-operator in the conditioning using the adjustment formula:\n\\[\nP(R=r \\mid \\mathit{do}(D=d)) = \\sum_{g \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(R=r \\mid D=d, G=g) \\ P(G=g)\n\\]\nThis means that we need to estimate two probability distributions: the conditional probability of recovery given drug and gender and the (marginal) probability of gender. We can use maximum-likelihood estimates for these by just using the observed frequencies as estimators.

The main learning goals are:\n\nlearning how to implement multilevel linear models with brms including\nunderstanding random intercept models\nunderstanding random slope models\n\n\n\nOne way to motivate multi-level modeling is by noting that, without group-level terms, the model would be making strong (possibly) implausible independence assumptions.\nAs a motivating example, let us look at the probability of observing a straight trajectory predicted by response latency in the mouse tracking data set. Here a the plot for all data in the click group plus a logistic smooth term:\n\n\nToggle code\n# set up data frame\ndolphin_agg &lt;- dolphin %&gt;% \n  filter(correct == 1,\n         group == \"click\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(straight = as.factor(ifelse(prototype_label == \"straight\", 1, 0)),\n         log_RT_s = my_scale(log(RT)),\n         AUC_s = my_scale(AUC))\n\ndolphin_agg$straight_numeric &lt;- as.numeric(as.character(dolphin_agg$straight))\n\n# plot predicted values against data\nggplot(data = dolphin_agg,\n       aes(x = log_RT_s, y = straight_numeric)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(height = 0.02), alpha = 0.2) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"glm\", color = project_colors[2],\n    method.args = list(family = \"binomial\"), \n    se = FALSE, fullrange = TRUE) +\n  ggtitle(\"overall relationship\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThis picture suggest a negative relationship between the probability of observing straight trajectories (y) and people’s response times (x) (i.e. line goes down).\nBut this analysis looked at all responses at once and disregarded that responses came from groups of sources. For example, responses that come from one and the same participant are dependent on each other because participants (subject_id) might differ in characteristics relevant to the task, like how fast they move and how many times they move to the target in a straight trajectory. Another group of data points is related to different stimuli (exemplars). Different stimuli might have some inherent properties that lead to different response times and different proportions of straight trajectories. So analyzing the data without telling the model about these groups violates an important assumption of linear models. The independence assumption.\nLet’s look at these groups individually, starting by aggregating over over subject_ids and exemplars and plot the results.\n\n\nToggle code\n# aggregate over subjects\ndolphin_agg2 &lt;- dolphin_agg %&gt;% \n  group_by(subject_id) %&gt;% \n  summarize(log_RT_s = mean(log_RT_s),\n            straights = sum(straight_numeric),\n            total = n()) \n\n# plot predicted values for subjects\nggplot(data = dolphin_agg2,\n       aes(x = log_RT_s, y = straights/total)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.5) +\n  # we use the geom_smooth function here as a rough proxy of the relationship \n  geom_smooth(method = \"glm\", \n              formula = y ~ x, color = project_colors[2],\n    method.args = list(family = \"binomial\"), \n    se = FALSE, fullrange = TRUE) +\n  ylab(\"Proportion of straight trajs\") +\n  ylim(0,1) +\n  xlim(-2.5,2.5) +\n  ggtitle(\"subject aggregates\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\")\n\n\n\n\n\nHuh. That is interesting. So if we aggregate over subjects, i.e. each data point is one subject reacting to all exemplars, we get a positive relationship between response latency and the proportion of straight trajectories. The slower the reaction the more likely a straight trajectory. That could mean that those participants that are generally slower are also the ones that tend to move more often in a straight fashion. It also makes sense to some extent. Maybe those participants seem to wait until they have made their decision and then move to the target immediately, while other participants move upwards right away and make their decision on the fly during the decision.\nNow, let’s aggregate over exemplars:\n\n\nToggle code\n# aggregate over exemplars\ndolphin_agg3 &lt;- dolphin_agg %&gt;% \n  group_by(exemplar) %&gt;% \n  summarize(log_RT_s = mean(log_RT_s),\n            straights = sum(straight_numeric),\n            total = n()) \n\n# plot predicted values for exemplars\nggplot(data = dolphin_agg3,\n       aes(x = log_RT_s, y = straights/total)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"glm\", \n              formula = y ~ x, color = project_colors[2],\n    method.args = list(family = \"binomial\"), \n    se = FALSE, fullrange = TRUE) +\n  ylab(\"Proportion of straight trajs\") +\n  ylim(0,1) +\n  xlim(-2.5,2.5) +\n  ggtitle(\"stimuli aggregates\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\")\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we look at the stimuli aggregates, i.e. each data point is one exemplar that all subjects have reacted to, we get a negative relationship between response latency and the proportion of straight trajectories. The quicker the reaction the more likely a straight trajectory. This could potentially reflect the difficulty of the categorization task. Maybe those exemplars that are inherently less ambiguous, for example the typical exemplars, don’t exhibit any response competition and are thus faster and more often straight.\nUltimately, we use our models to make a generalizing statement about a population. If our theory predicts a relationship between straight trajectories and response latency (without further nuance), we should find this relationship across the population of people AND the population of stimuli. But if we say, “there are more straight trajectories in faster responses”, this claim seems to be only true for within-participant behavior. So we need to inform our models about such groupings in our data, or we might overconfidently make predictions."

In this unit we look at the third, model comparison.\nModel comparison is deeply related to the second point: making predictions. We compare models based on their ability to predict data well enough. But not exclusively! We might also rely on other aspects, such as whether a model makes fewer spurious assumptions, i.e., is simpler, more economical or more parsimonious.\nAs usual, there is not one criterion for model comparison that everybody unanimously agrees to as the best. As usual, this is likely because “goodness of a model” is a multi-dimensional concept. What counts as a good model for science (knowledge gain; theoretical understanding) need not be the same as for engineering or application (getting high-quality predictions in the most efficient manner).\nThis unit therefore centers on two important tools for Bayesian model comparison that lie at opposite ends of a continuous spectrum, namely Bayes factors and leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation. Bayes factors take the most extreme point of view of ex ante predictions: we compare models without any updating on the relevant data. LOO-CV, on the other hand, take the (almost) most extreme point of view of ex post predictions, comparing models that are trained on all of the relevant data, except one single data observations.\nIn the practical session, we explore how these different perspectives can give rise to opposite results. This is not a puzzle or paradox, and maybe not even something to quarrel about. It is a natural reflex of comparing the same objects based on a different task, namely making predictions before training, or after.\nHere are slides for this unit."
