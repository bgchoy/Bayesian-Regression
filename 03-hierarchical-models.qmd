This unit introduces hierarchical regression models (also known as mixed models, or random-effect models).

<!-- Here are [slides for this session](slides/03-MLM.pdf). -->

There are also tutorials covering [multi-membership group-level effects](https://michael-franke.github.io/Bayesian-Regression/practice-sheets/02c-multi-membership.html) and an [alternative motivation for using multi-level modeling](https://michael-franke.github.io/Bayesian-Regression/practice-sheets/02d-MLM-pooling.html) which is not "breaking the wrong independence assumptions".
