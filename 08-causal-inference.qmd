This unit introduces the basics of causal inference, following the approach of Judea Pearl.
The material presented here draws heavily on [this excellent primer](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/PRIMER/).
What we add to this is the Bayesian-regression perspective.
We show how to quantify uncertainty of estimates of causal effects, using Bayesian regression modeling.

There is a short [exercise script on stochastic dependence and causal relation](https://michael-franke.github.io/Bayesian-Regression/practice-sheets/06a-stochastic-dependence.html),
and a [tutorial script on causal inference](https://michael-franke.github.io/Bayesian-Regression/practice-sheets/06b-causal-inference.html).
