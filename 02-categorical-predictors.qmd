This chapter covers treatment of categorical predictors in linear regression, using **contrast coding**.
We learn how to set contrasts, interpret results and use samples to retrieve information on contrasts that we did not encode in the contrast scheme.

<!-- Here are the [slides on regression modeling](slides/01-intro-simpleRegress.pdf). -->

<!-- Follow up [slides on priors and predictives](slides/02-priors-predictives.pdf). -->

There is a theoretical tutorial on the topic, as well as an tutorial with practical exercises.

There is also a sheet with additional exercises (simple linear regression with metric and categorical variables).
