This chapter introduces the basics of Bayesian linear regression modeling.

<!-- Here are the [slides on regression modeling](slides/01-intro-simpleRegress.pdf). -->

<!-- Follow up [slides on priors and predictives](slides/02-priors-predictives.pdf). -->

There are four tutorials, covering:

1. simple linear regression models (with `WebPPL`),
2. simple linear regression models (with `brms`),
3. how to inspect and set priors in `brms`, and
4. how to obtain prior and predictive samples with `brms`.
